<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>


<p>When her husband and her guests came
downstairs at one o&rsquo;clock, they found the
Princess Nadine looking her loveliest.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you lazy people!&rsquo; she cried to them.
&lsquo;Are you any the better for sleeping like that?
Look at me. I have been swimming half an hour;
I have dictated twenty letters; I have scolded
the gardeners, and I have seen three boxes from
Worth unpacked; it is only one o&rsquo;clock, and I
can already feel as good a conscience as Titus.
I have already saved my day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I daresay you have only been doing mischief,&rsquo;
said Lady Brancepeth. &lsquo;I should like to
see the letters before I judge of the excellence
of your actions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Anyone might see the letters; they are all
orders, or invitations, or refusals of invitations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
quite stupid, but very useful; epistolary omnibus
horses driven by the secretary. When I
had done with them, I had my half hour&rsquo;s
swim. What nonsense the doctors talk about
not swimming in winter: the chill of the water
is delicious. In summer one always fancies
the sea has been boiled. Platon, if you had
not gone to bed, you would have seen your
friend Othmar. He was here for half an hour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar!&rsquo; exclaimed the Prince. &lsquo;Here
at that time of the morning?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He does not want to go to sleep,&rsquo; she
retorted. &lsquo;He had his chocolate with me, and
then rowed himself back to S. Pharamond
and Baron Fritz.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lady Brancepeth glanced at her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have certainly done a great deal,
Nadine, while we have been only dozing,&rsquo; she
said drily. The Princess looked at her good-humouredly,
with her little dubious smile.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is always something to do if one
only look for it. You feel so satisfied with
yourself too when you have been useful before
one o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar!&rsquo; repeated the Prince. &lsquo;If I had
known, I would have come downstairs.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Platon, you would have done
nothing of the kind; you would have sworn
at your man for disturbing you, and would
have turned round and gone to sleep again.
Besides, what do you want with Othmar?
You do not care about &ldquo;getting on a good
thing,&rdquo; nor even about suggesting a loan for
Odessa.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I like Othmar,&rsquo; said Napraxine with perfect
sincerity. His wife looked at him, with
her little dubious smile. &lsquo;It is always so with
them,&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;They always like just the
one man of all others&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose, if I had done quite what I
ought, I should have asked Othmar to &ldquo;put
me on&rdquo; something,&rsquo; she said aloud. &lsquo;It is not
every day that one has one of the masters of
the world all alone at eight o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The masters of the world always find their
Cleopatras,&rsquo; said Lady Brancepeth. &lsquo;At La
Jacquemerille, perhaps, as well as in Egypt.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Cleopatra must have been a very stupid
woman,&rsquo; said Nadine Napraxine, &lsquo;to be able
to think of nothing but that asp!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not know that it was so very stupid;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
it was a good <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réclame</i>. It has sent her name
down to us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Anthony alone would have done that. A
woman lives by her lovers. Who would have
heard of Héloïse, of Beatrice, of Leonora
d&rsquo;Este?&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very modest for us. Perhaps
without the women the men might never have
been immortal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cannot think why you sent Othmar
away,&rsquo; repeated Prince Napraxine. &lsquo;I wanted
especially to know if they take up the Russian
loan&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I did not send him away, he went,&rsquo; replied
his wife, with a little smile; &lsquo;and you know
he will never allow anyone to talk finance
to him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is very absurd. He cannot deny that
his House lives by finance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He would certainly never deny it, but he
dislikes the fact; you cannot force it on him,
my dear Platon, in the course of breakfast chit-chat.
I am sure your manners are better than
that. Besides, if you did commit such a rudeness,
you would get nothing by it. I believe he
never tells a falsehood, but he will never tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
the truth unless he chooses. And I suppose,
too, that financiers are like cabinet ministers&mdash;they
have a right to lie if they like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sure Othmar does not lie,&rsquo; said
Napraxine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I dare say he is as truthful as most men of
the world. Truth is not a social virtue; tact
is a much more amiable quality. Truth says
to one, &lsquo;You have not a good feature in your
face;&rsquo; tact says to one, &lsquo;You have an exquisite
expression.&rsquo; Perhaps both facts are equally
true; but the one only sees what is unpleasant,
the other only sees what is agreeable. There
can be no question which is the pleasanter
companion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar has admirable tact&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How your mind runs upon Othmar!
Kings generally acquire a great deal of tact
from the obligation to say something agreeable
to so many strangers all their lives. He is a
kind of king in his way. He has learnt the
kings&rsquo; art of saying a few phrases charmingly
with all his thoughts elsewhere. It is creditable
to him, for he has no need to be popular,
he is so rich.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ask him to dinner to-morrow or Sunday.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;If you wish. But he will not come; he
dislikes dinners as much as I do. It is the
most barbarous method of seeing one&rsquo;s friends.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is no other so genial.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She rose with a little shrug of her
shoulders. She seldom honoured Napraxine
by conversing so long with him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Order the horses, Ralph,&rsquo; she said to Lord
Geraldine; &lsquo;I want a long gallop.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She has had some decisive scene with
Othmar,&rsquo; thought Lady Brancepeth, &lsquo;and she
is out of humour; she always rides like a Don
Kossack when she is irritated.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is no real riding here,&rsquo; said the
Princess, as she went to put on her habit. &lsquo;One
almost loves Russia when one thinks of the way
one can ride there; of those green eternal
steppes, those illimitable plains, with no limit
but the dim grey horizon, your black Ukrane
horse, bounding like a deer, flying like a
zephyr; it is worth while to remain in Russia
to gallop so, on a midsummer night, with not
a wall or a fence all the way between you and
the Caspian Sea. I think if I were always in
Russia I should become such a poet as Maïkoff:
those immense distances are inspiration.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>She rode with exquisite grace and spirit;
an old Kossack had taught her, as a child, the
joys of the saddle, on those lonely and dreamful
plains, which had always held since a certain
place in her heart. That latent energy and
daring, which found no scope in the life of the
world, made her find pleasure in the strong
stride of the horse beneath her, in the cleaving
of the air at topmost speed. The most indolent
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaines</i> at all other times, when she
sprang into the saddle as lightly as a bird on a
bough, she was transformed; her slender
hands had a grip of steel, her delicate face
flushed with pleasure, the fiery soul of her
fathers woke in her&mdash;of the men who had
ridden out with their troopers to hunt down
the Persian and the Circassian; who had swept
like storm-clouds over those shadowy steppes
which she loved; who had had their part or
share in all the tragic annals of Russia; who
had slain their foes at the steps of the throne,
in the holiness of the cloister; who had been
amongst those whose swords had found the
heart of Cathrine&rsquo;s son, and whose voices had
cried to the people in the winter&rsquo;s morning,
&lsquo;Paul, the son of Peter, is dead; pray for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
soul!&rsquo; If she were cruel&mdash;now and then&mdash;was
it not in her blood?</p>

<p class="mt2">Meanwhile Yseulte was helping her foster-mother
to pack tea-roses, to go to England for
a great ball, in their little hermetically-sealed
boxes. The roses were not wholly opened
before they were thus shut away from light
and air into darkness. They would not wither
in their airless cells, but they would pale a
little in that dull sad voyage from the sunshine
to the frost and fog. As she laid the rosebuds,&mdash;pink,
white, and pale yellow,&mdash;one by one
on their beds of moss, she thought for the first
time wistfully that her fate was very like theirs;
only the rosebuds, perhaps, when they should
be taken out of their prisons at their journey&rsquo;s
end, though they would have but a very few
hours of life before them, yet would bloom a
little, if mournfully, in the northern land, and
see the light again, if only for a day. But her
life would be shut into silence and darkness for
ever; she would not even live the rose&rsquo;s life

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>


<p>When Othmar went out from her presence, he
was more near to happiness than he had been
in his whole thirty years of life. He was
filled with vivid, palpitating, intoxicated hope.
He was passionately in love, and almost he
believed himself beloved in return. As much
as she had allowed to him she had certainly
allowed to no living man. The very force of
his passion, which had driven him to scorn the
conventional court which he might have paid
her in common with so many others&mdash;the
spaniel&rsquo;s place of Geraldine, the slave&rsquo;s place of
Boris Seliedoff&mdash;rendered him as willing to set
no limits to the sacrifices which she should
be free to exact from him, and he be proud to
make. Only he would never share her, even
in nominal union with her lawful lord. He
would be all to her, or nothing.</p>

<p>He loathed the conventional adulteries of
his time and of his society; he sighed, im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>patiently
for the means to prove that the old
fearless, high-handed, single-hearted passion
which sees in the whole teeming world only
one life, was not dead, but lived in him for
her.</p>

<p>He foresaw all the loss of freedom and of
fair repute which would be entailed on him
by the surrender of his life to her; he knew
well that she was a woman who would be no
docile companion or unexacting mistress; he
knew that there were in her the habits of
dominance, the instincts of egotism, and that
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit gouailleur</i> which compelled her, almost
despite herself, to jest at what she admired, to
ridicule her better emotions, to make a mockery
of the very things which were the dearest to her.
He did not because he loved her become blind
to all that was cold, merciless, and capricious in
her nature; he was conscious that she would
never lose her own identity in any passion,
never surrender her mind, even if she gave her
person, to any lover; he knew that she would
always remain outside those tropic tempests
of love which she aroused and controlled, and
which offended her or flattered her, according
to the mood in which they found her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>He knew all these things, and was aware
that his future would not be one of peace. But
he loved her, and agitation, jealousy, suffering
beside her would, he felt, be sweeter to him
than any repose beside another. Even these
defects, these dangers, which he clearly perceived,
added to her sorcery for him. It is
the mistress who is indifferent who excites the
most vehement desires; and, by reason of his
great fortunes, women had been always to him
so facile, so eager, and so easily won, that the
coldness of Nadine Napraxine, which he knew
was a thing of temperament, not of affectation,
had but the more irresistible power over him.
The very sense with which she impressed everyone,
himself as well as others, of being no more
to be held or relied upon than the snowflake,
to which her world likened her, attracted a
man who had, from his boyhood, been wearied
by the adulation, insistence, and sycophancy
of almost all who approached him.</p>

<p>The few days of his probation passed slowly
over his head, seeming as though they would
never end. He was restless, feverish, and
absent of mind; Friederich Othmar, who,
contrary to all his usual habits, remained at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
S. Pharamond, tranquilly ignoring the visible
impatience of his host at his unasked presence,
was sorely troubled by the alternate exhilaration
and anxiety of spirit which all the reserve
and self-possession of Othmar himself could not
wholly conceal from the penetration of a person
accustomed to divine and dive into the innermost
recesses of the minds of men.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What, in God&rsquo;s name, is he meditating?&rsquo;
thought his uncle. &lsquo;Some insanity probably.
I should believe he was about to disappear
from the world with Madame Napraxine if
I were not so persuaded that her pride and her
selfishness will never permit her to commit
a folly for anyone. Morality is nothing to her,
but her position is a great deal; her delight in
being insolent will never allow her to lose the
power of being so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So accurately did this man of the world
read a character which baffled most persons by
its intricacy and its anomalies.</p>

<p>To Friederich Othmar human nature presented
many absurdities but few secrets.</p>

<p>He remained at S. Pharamond, despite his
own abhorrence of any place which was not a
capital. He passed his mornings in the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>sideration
of his correspondence and his telegraphic
despatches, but in the later hours of
the day and in the evenings he was that
agreeable member of society whom society had
known and courted for so many years; and
beneath his pleasant subacid wit and his
admirable manner his acute penetration was
for ever <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en vedette</i> to penetrate his nephew&rsquo;s
purpose and preoccupation. But a lover, on
his guard, will baffle an observer whom the
keenest of statesmen would, in vain, seek to
deceive or mislead, and the Baron learned
nothing of Othmar&rsquo;s inmost thoughts. Although
Othmar and Nadine Napraxine met twice or
thrice in his presence at other people&rsquo;s houses,
and once at S. Pharamond itself, where some
more choice music was given one evening, the
acute blue eyes of the elder man failed to read
the understanding which existed between them.
All he saw was that she appeared to treat
Othmar, before others, with more raillery and
more nonchalance than usual. He remarked
that Othmar did not seem either hurt or surprised
at this.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Since he is as much in love with her
as ever, he must be aware of some intimacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
between them which renders him comparatively
insensible to her treatment of him in society,&rsquo;
thought the sagacity of his uncle, who was
alarmed and disquieted by a fact which would
have reassured less fine observers&mdash;the fact that
the master of S. Pharamond did not once,
during fifteen days, cross the mile or two of
olive-wood, orange orchard, and hanging field
which alone separated him from La Jacquemerille.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No love is so patient but on some promise,&rsquo;
he reflected. He knew the romantic
turn of Othmar&rsquo;s character, and he feared its
results as others would fear the issue of some
mortal or hereditary disease. A week or two
previous the ministers then presiding over the
fortunes of France had met, at his little house
in the Rue du Traktir, the representatives of
two great Powers, and in the newspapers of
the hour that informal meeting, which had led
to many important results, had been called the
Unwritten Treaty of Baron Fritz; and yet, at
such a moment, instead of being entranced with
such influence as such a nickname implied to
his House, instead of being occupied with the
power, the might, and the mission of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Othmars, which that gathering around the
library-table in the Rue du Traktir displayed
for the ten thousandth time to the dazzled
eyes of suppliant and trembling Europe, Otho
himself could only think of a woman with
larger eyes and smaller hands than usual, but
a woman absolutely useless to him in any
ambitions&mdash;likely, rather, to be his ruin in all
ways!</p>

<p>&lsquo;I could understand it were she one of
the great political forces of the world. Some
women are that, and might so, to us, be of very
high value,&rsquo; thought Friederich Othmar, &lsquo;but
Madame Napraxine is as indifferent to all political
movement as if she were made of the ivory
and mother-of-pearl which her skin resembles.
If she be anything, she is that horrible thing a
Nihilist, only because Nihilism embodies an
endless and irreconcilable discontent, which
finds in her some secret corner of vague sympathy.
But for politics in our meaning of the
word she has the most complete contempt.
What did she say to me the other day? &ldquo;I am a
diplomatist&rsquo;s daughter. I have seen the strings
of all your puppets. I cannot accept a Polichinelle
for a Richelieu, as you all do.&rdquo; And she de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>clared
that if there were no statesmen at all, and
no journalists, life would go smoothly; everybody
would attend to their own affairs, the
world would be quiet, and there would be no
wars. What but disaster can such a woman
with such views bring into the life of Otho,
already paralysed as it is by poco-curantism?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He asked the question of himself in his own
meditations, and could give himself no answer
save one which grieved and alarmed him.</p>

<p>Othmar himself bestowed on his guest but
little thought except a passing impatience that
his uncle should have taken that moment, of all
others, to instal himself at S. Pharamond.</p>

<p>He had not the cynicism nor the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insouciance</i>
of the woman he adored. He did not attempt
any sophisms with his own conscience. He
knew that to do a man dishonour was to do
him a violence unkinder, and perhaps even in a
way baser, than to take his life. But he was
ready to pledge himself to that which, unlike
her, he still considered was a sin. He was
entirely mastered by a force of passion which
she could have understood by the subtlety of
her intelligence, but was not likely ever to
share by any fibre of her nature. He was lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
in that whirlpool of emotion, anticipation, and
fear which carried his inner life away on it,
although his outer life remained in appearance
calm enough for no eyes save those of the
Baron to penetrate the disguise of his serenity.</p>

<p>Yseulte he had forgotten.</p>

<p>The simple and innocent tenderness which
she had momentarily aroused in him could not
hold its place beside the overwhelming passion
which governed him, more than a slender
soft-eyed dove can dispute possession with the
fierce, strong-pinioned falcon. Once or twice
he saw her and spoke to her with kindness, but
his thoughts were far away from her, and he
did not linger beside her, although each time
he chanced to meet her on the way to her
foster-mother&rsquo;s, in lonely lovely country paths,
which might well have tempted him to tarry.</p>

<p>On the thirteenth day of his probation, the
priest&rsquo;s gown which, to please her, he had
ordered for the church of S. Pharamond, arrived
at the château, and, his attention being drawn
to it by his servants, he remembered his promise
to her. It was the last day of the year. A
passing remembrance of pity came over him as
he thought of her; she was so entirely alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and she would go to the life of the cloister; a
fancy came to him to do some little thing to
give her pleasure; a mere evanescent breath of
innocent impulse, which passed like the cool
breeze of an April day, sweet with scent of
field flowers, across the heated atmosphere of
desire and expectation in which his soul was
then living. Conventional etiquette had seldom
troubled him greatly; he had always enjoyed
something of that sense which princes have,
that whatever he did the world would condone.
A man of the exceptional power which he
possessed can always exercise on his contemporaries
more or less of his own will. Whatever
he might have done no one would have
said of him anything more severe than that he
was singular.</p>

<p>When he went into Nice that day he
chanced to see a very pretty thing, modern,
but admirable in taste and execution, a casket
of ivory mounted on silver, with a little angel
in silver on the summit. On its sides were
painted in delicate miniatures reproductions of
Fra Angelico and Botticelli. It was signed
by a famous miniaturist, and cost ten thousand
francs. Othmar, to whom the price seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
no more than ten centimes, bought it at
once.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It will please her,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;It shall
go to her with the soutane;&rsquo; and he sent it
with the vestment to Millo, addressed to Mademoiselle
de Valogne. His knowledge of etiquette
told him that he ought to send it, if he sent it
at all, through the Duchesse; but he did not
choose to obey etiquette; he had discarded
social rules, more or less, all his life, according
to his inclination, and people had not resented
his rebellion simply because he was who he
was. He utterly disobeyed etiquette now, and
sent his present direct to Yseulte very early
on the morning of the New Year.</p>

<p>It did not occur to him that he might only
run the risk of cruelly compromising the poor
child. He gave hardly more thought to the
action than he would have given to a rose
which he might have broken off its stalk to
offer to her. All his heart had gone with the
basket of flowers which he had sent at sunrise
to Nadine Napraxine, who allowed no other
offering.</p>

<p>The chances were a million to one that his
casket would never reach its destination without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
being seen, if not intercepted, by the governesses;
but as it happened, his messenger gave
it to the gatekeeper, and the gatekeeper gave
it in turn to the woman who served her as
maid during her stay at Millo, and who was
passing through the gates, on her way home
from matins. The woman was attached to her;
indeed, being a religious person herself, considered
that Yseulte was the only creature whose
presence saved Millo from the fate of Sodom
and Gomorrah; therefore, pleased that the girl
should have pleasure, she carried the packet
straight to her as she rose from her bed; and in
the cold, misty morning of the New Year the
first thing that greeted the astonished eyes of
Yseulte was the Coronation of the Virgin,
glowing like a jewel on the side of the ivory
casket.</p>

<p>The whole day passed to her in an enchanted
rapture.</p>

<p>In the large, idle, careless household there
was a general exchange of congratulations and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étrennes</i>, and a pleasant tumult of good wishes
and merriment. Blanchette and Toinon danced
about before a pyramid of bonbons and costly
playthings, and the Duchesse, descending at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
usual hour, two o&rsquo;clock, gave and received a
multitude of felicitations, gifts, and visits. &lsquo;The
most tedious day of the whole three hundred
and sixty-five,&rsquo; she said pettishly, giving her
cheek to the touch of her children&rsquo;s pale little
lips.</p>

<p>In the many occupations and ennuis of
the day no one heard or knew anything of
Othmar&rsquo;s present. At noon some bouquets of
roses and some orchids, laid on a plate of old
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cloisonné</i> enamel, were brought in his name to
Madame de Vannes, but she knew nothing of
her cousin&rsquo;s casket. Meanwhile nothing could
hurt Yseulte. The contempt with which her
little cousins received the gifts she had made for
them in the convent, the oblivion to which she
was consigned by every one, the carelessness
with which the Duchesse received her timidly-offered
good wishes, the severity with which
the governesses forbade her to go out in such
weather to see Nicole or attend Mass in the
little church, the unconcealed ill-temper with
which Alain de Vannes flung her a word of
greeting&mdash;none of these things had any power
to wound her; she scarcely perceived them;
she was lifted up into a world all her own.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Unnoticed in the general <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">branle-bas</i> of the day,
she passed the hours, when she was not at
Mass in the chapel, locked safely in her own
room, before her treasure, in a rapt happiness,
in a wonder of ecstasy, which were so intense
that she feared they were cardinal sins.</p>

<p>The weather was cold, some snow had even
fallen, and the north winds blew, making all the
chilly foreigners gathered on those shores
shiver and grumble like creatures defrauded of
their rights; but all the grey, cheerless, misty
landscape, and the fog upon the sea, appeared
more beautiful to her than they had ever done
before in its sunshine. From her window she
looked at the towers of S. Pharamond, and
on her table&mdash;all her own&mdash;was the ivory
casket.</p>

<p>The Duchesse de Vannes, waking in the
forenoon after the Jour de l&rsquo;An, cross, peevish,
sleepy, and yet sleepless, which is, in itself, the
most irritating and dispiriting of all human
conditions, and morbidly conscious that, as her
little daughter had said, she was beginning to
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">baisser un peu</i>, was in a mood of natural resentment
against all creation in general and the
human race in particular, and quite ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
vent her ill-humour on the first object which
offered itself. That first object was one of the
little prim notes by which her children&rsquo;s instructresses
were wont to communicate any
terrible event in the schoolroom, or any entreaty
for guidance when Mademoiselle Blanchette
had insisted on riding the wooden horses
at a village fair, or Mademoiselle Toinon had
dressed herself up in the smallest groom&rsquo;s
clothes. &lsquo;Ne m&rsquo;ennuyez pas; vous savez vos
devoirs&rsquo; was the only reply they ever received;
but the good women continued to write the
notes as a relief to their consciences. They
wrote one now, signed in their joint names,
humbly entreating to be informed if it were
the pleasure of Madame la Duchesse that
Mdlle. de Valogne should receive presents of
which the donor was unknown. Mdlle. de
Valogne was in possession of a new and very
valuable locket; they believed also that she
was in the habit of going to the gardens
of S. Pharamond; they had deemed it their
duty to acquaint Madame la Duchesse, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Blanchette, with the most innocent face in
the world, had said to them, &lsquo;I have seen the
big pearl locket of Yseulte! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh, vrai!</i> When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
I am as old, I will not hide my handsome
things as she does. Who gave it her? Who
do you think could give it to her? She is
friends with that gentleman at S. Pharamond&mdash;the
one that is as rich as M. de Rothschild.
I think he gave it her! Do you tell mamma.&lsquo;</p>

<p>Blanchette guessed very shrewdly that her
father had given the locket; but she was too
wary to offend him. Blanchette was like the
little cats who steal round and round to their
mouse by devious paths unseen. She had
alarmed the governesses, and the prim note was
the consequence.</p>

<p>When the Duchesse read it, she flung it
away in a corner. &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tas d&rsquo;imbéciles</i>,&rsquo; she said,
contemptuously; then said to one of her maids,
&lsquo;Request Mdlle. de Valogne to come hither.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte was presented in a fortuitous moment
as the whipping-boy on whom could be
spent all that useless irritation which she could
not spend on the real offenders, her ineffective
chloral, her increasing wrinkles, and the indifference
of Raymond de Prangins.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mamma is always cross,&rsquo; the wise little
Blanchette had reflected. &lsquo;She is always angry,
even for nothing. That great baby will get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a lecture, and she will be sure to say it was
papa; she always tells the truth&mdash;such a
simpleton!&mdash;and papa will hate her for ever
and for ever!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Blanchette made a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied de nez</i> all by
herself in her little bedroom: when you were
a child you could not have many things your
own way, but you could spoil other people&rsquo;s
things very neatly with a little pat here, a little
poke there, if you looked all the while like
your picture by Baudry, an innocent cherub
with sweet smiling eyes, who could not have
made a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied de nez</i> to save your life. Blanchette
had already acquired the knowledge
that this was how the world was most easily
managed.</p>

<p>When Yseulte was summoned to her cousin&rsquo;s
presence, the girl was startled to see how old
she looked, for it was scarcely noon, and the
handsome face which &lsquo;Cri-Cri&rsquo; was wont to
present to her own world had scarcely received
its finishing touches from the various embellishing
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits secrets</i> shut up in their silver
boxes and their china pots, which were strewn
about under the great Dresden-framed mirror
in front of her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-day,&rsquo; she said, with irritation already
in her voice, as Yseulte timidly kissed her hand.
&lsquo;Is this true what they tell me, that you receive
presents without my knowledge and consent?
Do you not know that it is perfectly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">inconvenable</i>?
Are you not taught enough of the
world in your convent to be aware that a
young girl cannot do such things without being
disgraced eternally? What is it you have
accepted? Is it a jewel? Can you realise the
enormity of your action?&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; she paused, in
some irritation and uncertainty. &lsquo;Well, why
do you not speak? Can you excuse yourself?
What is it you have taken? From whom have
you taken it? My people have told me you
have a new and valuable jewel and refuse to
say who gave it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My cousin, M. le Duc, gave it me,&rsquo; said
Yseulte. &lsquo;He said that I was to tell you if you
asked me, but not anyone else.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She spoke frankly, without any hesitation.
The Duchesse stared at her, half rose in her
amazement; her face was dark with anger
for a moment, then cleared into a sudden
laughter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My husband!&rsquo; she echoed. &lsquo;A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i> like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
you! And they say there are no miracles
now! Do you absolutely mean to say that
Alain gave you a jewel?&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He was so good as to give me a locket&mdash;yes,&rsquo;
murmured Yseulte, conscious that her
cousin was angry, insolent, and derisive, and
afraid that the Duc would be irritated at the
issue of his kindness to her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray, has he given you anything else?&rsquo;
echoed Madame de Vannes. &lsquo;Has he given
you the diamonds he had bought for Mdlle.
Rubis, or the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé</i> from Bender&rsquo;s which he
meant for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la grande</i> Laure?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He has not given me anything else,&rsquo;
answered Yseulte, to whom these terrible names
conveyed no meaning.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where is this locket? Show it me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is in my room. Shall I fetch it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, no. It does not matter. You can
send it me. I will send Agnès for it. The
idea of Alain having even looked at you!&mdash;it
makes one laugh; it is too absurd.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She continued to laugh, but the laughter
did not convey to the ear of Yseulte any
impression either that she was pardoned or that
her cousin was amused. It was a laugh ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>pressive
of irony, irritation, wonder, contempt,
rancour, all in one.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You should not have taken it. You should
have told me,&rsquo; continued the Duchesse. &lsquo;To
be sure, he is your cousin. But it is not
proper to take a man&rsquo;s gifts. It is not becoming.
It is too forward. It is even immodest.
Is that the sort of thing the Dames
de Ste. Anne have taught you? Surely you
might have known better.&rsquo;</p>

<p>These phrases she uttered in a staccato
rapid succession, as if she thought little of
what she said; she was indeed thinking as the
girl stood before her:</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a skin! What shoulders! What a
throat! What a thing it is to be sixteen!
Why did not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le bon Dieu</i> make all that last
longer with us? It goes too soon; so horribly
soon; after one is five-and-twenty it is all one
can do to make up decently. If it were only
the complexion which went it would not matter;
that one can easily arrange; but it is the
features that change; they grow out or they
grow in; the mouth gets thin or the cheeks get
broad; the very lines alter somehow, and we
cannot alter that; and then to make oneself up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
is as much trouble as to build a house, and the
house has to be built anew every day!&mdash;it is
horribly hard&mdash;and yet one has compensations,
revenges; it is not those children whom men
care to look at though they are fresh as roses;
at least not usually. Alain, I suppose, does&mdash;what
can he mean by giving her a medallion?&rsquo;</p>

<p>While these thoughts ran through her
mind, she was staring hard at Yseulte through
her eyeglass, as though they had never met
before then. The girl had coloured scarlet at
the epithet &lsquo;immodest,&rsquo; but it had made her a
little angry, with the righteous indignation of
innocence. Respect kept her mute, but her
face spoke for her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alain was right; she is really handsome,&rsquo;
reflected the Duchesse.</p>

<p>She was herself only eight-and-twenty, but
in the world as on the racecourse it is the
pace that kills; and before she had passed
through all those arduous processes which she
had rightly compared to building a house anew
every day, she knew very well that she looked
cruelly old, though after two o&rsquo;clock in the day
she was still one of the great beauties of France.</p>

<p>She had been immersed in pleasures, pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>times,
and excitements from the day of her
marriage; she had lived in a crowd, she had
gambled not a little, and she had had certain
intrigues, of whose dangers she had at times a
vivid and anxious consciousness, for the Duc
was indifferent but not base, and might any day
be roused if he came to be aware that men
laughed at him more than he liked. As a rule,
she and he understood each other very well,
and tacitly condoned each other&rsquo;s indiscretions;
but there might come a time when he would
break that convenient compact, as she felt disposed
now to resent his admiration of her
young cousin. On the whole, perhaps, she
mused, she had been wrong to do so; she
would let the girl keep his present; he might,
if she provoked him, insist that Raymond de
Prangins should leave Millo. All these reflections
occurred to her during that one minute
in which her eyeglass watched the indignation
rise in Yseulte&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have you seen M. de Vannes alone?&rsquo; she
resumed, with a sharpness in her voice, due
rather to her own sense of the girl&rsquo;s beauty
than to her knowledge of her husband&rsquo;s admiration
for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Now and then,&rsquo; said Yseulte without
hesitation. &lsquo;He has come into the schoolroom&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;For a lesson in A B C, I suppose?&mdash;or a
cup of Brown&rsquo;s green tea?&rsquo; said the Duchesse
contemptuously. &lsquo;Well, he may <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conter ses
fleurettes ailleurs</i>. I should have thought he
had had better taste than to begin in his own
house: however,&rsquo; she continued, interrupting
herself, as she remembered that she was suggesting,
&lsquo;I do not suppose it is you who are to
blame. But another time, ask my permission
before you accept anything from anybody. I
will not deprive you of the Duc&rsquo;s gift. He is
in a manner your cousin&mdash;your guardian&mdash;of
course he meant very kindly, but another
time remember to come to me. You will tell
the Duc that I said so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; she was thinking, &lsquo;who
would have supposed that Alain had a taste for
a creature like that, half a saint and half a
baby? To be sure, her eyes are superb, and
the throat and bosom&mdash;what beautiful lines
they have; why did they send her here? She
shall go back next week. The wickedness of
the thing would charm him; the nearer it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to a crime, the more of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clou</i> it would be. To
play Faust under the respectable shade of
Brown&rsquo;s teapot and the big dictionaries would
be sure to enthral him, out of its very drollery&mdash;men
are made like that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then a remembrance of S. Pharamond
passed over her, and she said aloud, with an
unkind sarcasm in her voice:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you have other friends beside M.
de Vannes? Pray tell me if you have. I fully
appreciate the effects of the education which
the Dames de Ste. Anne have given you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte coloured scarlet, and the Duchesse&rsquo;s
eyes scanned her face as Blanchette&rsquo;s had done,
without mercy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray tell me,&rsquo; she continued, with a chill
dignity, which was in sharp contrast with the
sarcasm and railing of her previous manner.
&lsquo;You will be so good as to remember that I
stand in the place of your mother; your indiscretions
are not alone painful to me, but compromising
to me. Is it true that you are
intimate with Otho Othmar?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He has been kind to me,&rsquo; murmured
Yseulte, an agony at her heart and the hot
tears standing in her eyes. She did not under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>stand
enough of the world to justify herself by
the fact that the offender had been presented to
her by her cousin herself; nor, if she had done
so, would the position she stood in towards
Madame de Vannes have allowed her to use
such a justification without apparent impertinence.
For eight years she had owed everything
to the Duchesse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Kind to you!&rsquo; echoed her cousin, &lsquo;a most
fortuitous phrase, but not one that young girls
can employ except to their own ridicule and
injury. Pray how has he been kind to you?
has <em>he</em> given you a locket?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte might easily have told a lie; no
one knew of the casket, no one could tell of it;
she loved it more dearly than anything she had
ever possessed. But she had been taught in
her childhood that falsehood was cowardice,
and the courage of the de Valogne was in her;
therefore she answered, with an unsteady voice
indeed, but with entire truthfulness, &lsquo;He has
given me a very beautiful box, it is made of
ivory and painted, it came yesterday&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Madame de Vannes burst into another
laugh, which jarred on the child&rsquo;s ear:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Really,&rsquo; she cried, relapsing into the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
most natural to her, &lsquo;you begin well! Othmar
and my husband! and you are not quite
sixteen yet, and we all thought you such a
little demure saint in your grey clothes! Send
the casket to me. You cannot receive presents
in that way. From your cousin, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passe encore</i>,
but from a man like Othmar&mdash;you might as
well go and sup with him at Bignon&rsquo;s. Good
heavens! What are Schemmitz and Brown
about that they have let you meet him?
Where have you seen him? how have you
become intimate with him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte had become very pale. She had
done her duty; done what honour, truth, obedience,
and gratitude all required; but it had
cost her a great effort, and she would lose the
casket.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have only seen him three times,&rsquo; she
said, with her colour changing; and she went
on to tell the story of her visit to his gardens,
of his conversation with her on the seashore,
of the priest&rsquo;s soutane, and of their meeting
at the house of Nicole. It was a very simple
inoffensive little story, but it hurt her greatly
to tell it; cost her quite as much as it would
have done Madame de Vannes to unfold all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
her manifold indiscretions in full confession
before a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conseil de famille</i>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He has been very kind to me,&rsquo; she said
timidly, as she finished her little tale, &lsquo;and if&mdash;if&mdash;if
you would only let me keep the casket
and take it to Faïel?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Duchesse laughed once more:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You do not care to keep the Duc&rsquo;s locket&mdash;how
flattering to him! Really, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>, you
are sagacious betimes; I would never have believed
you such a cunning little cat! Did you
learn all that at the convent? you convent-girls
are more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rusées</i> than so many rats!
Othmar, of all men of the world! My dear,
you might as well wish for an emperor. There
is not a marriageable woman in Europe who
does not sigh for Othmar! He is so enormously
rich! There is no one else rich
like that; all the other financiers have a tribe
of people belonging to them. &ldquo;The family&rdquo; is
everywhere, at Paris, at Vienna, at Berlin, at
London, and have as many branches as the
oak; but Othmar is absolutely alone&mdash;for old
Baron Fritz does not count&mdash;he is absolutely
alone, that is what is unique in him. Whoever
marries him will be the most fortunate woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in Europe. Yes, I say it advisedly, it is fortune
that is power nowadays; our day is over; we
do not even lead society any longer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The colour had rushed back into Yseulte&rsquo;s
face; the Duchesse&rsquo;s words tortured her as only
a very young and sensitive creature can be
tortured by an indelicate and cruel suspicion.
&lsquo;I never thought, I never meant,&rsquo; she murmured.
&lsquo;You know, my cousin, I am dedicated
to the religious life; you cannot suppose
that I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; The words choked her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ne pleurnichez pas, de grâce!</i>&rsquo; said the
Duchesse impatiently. &lsquo;I have no doubt you
have taken all kinds of impossibilities into your
head, girls are always so foolish; but you may
be sure that the gift of the casket means nothing&mdash;nothing.
Othmar is always giving away,
right and left; most very rich men are mean, but
he is not. It was a wrong thing, an impertinent
thing, for him to do, and it must be returned
to him instantly; but if you imagine you have
made any impression upon him, I can assure
you you are very mistaken, he only thinks of
Nadine Napraxine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte remained very pale; her eyes were
cast down, her lips were pressed together. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
had done her duty and told the truth, but she
was not recompensed.</p>

<p>The Duchesse rang for her maids. To the
one who answered the summons, she said:
&lsquo; Accompany Mdlle. de Valogne to her room,
and bring me a casket she will give you, which
is to be sold for the Little Sisters of the Poor.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Va-t&rsquo; -en, Yseulte.</i>&rsquo;</p>

<p>She put out her hand carelessly, and the
girl bent over her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My cousin! I have never seen him but
three times,&rsquo; she murmured again. Her face
was very pale; she had been wounded profoundly
by the Duchesse&rsquo;s words, even though
their full meaning was not known to her.</p>

<p>Madame de Vannes laughed again; then,
with an assumption of dignity, which she could
take on at will, said coldly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Once was too much. Never accuse accident;
no one believes in it. Remember also,
that as one vowed to the service of Heaven, it
is already sin in you if you harbour one earthly
thought. Go, and send me the casket.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Without another word Yseulte curtsied and
withdrew from her presence.</p>

<p>When the maid returned, she brought her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
mistress the ivory casket; but inside it was the
Duc&rsquo;s medallion. Madame de Vannes laughed
yet again as she saw.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The little obstinate!&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;It
is not often that Alain throws pearls, or anything
else away. And what a casket! Heavens!
it is fit for a wedding gift to a queen. Is it
possible that Othmar&mdash;&mdash; No, it is not possible;
he would never think of a child like
that. Perhaps he did it to rouse Nadine.
What a cunning little pole-cat these nuns have
sent me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But a kind of respect awakened in her
towards her young cousin. A girl who could
charm Alain de Vannes and Othmar was not
to be dismissed scornfully as a novice and a
baby. The Duchesse drew some note-paper to
her, and wrote a little letter to her neighbour,
in which she expressed herself very admirably,
with dignity and grace, as the guardian of a
motherless child who was dedicated to the
service of Heaven. She suggested, without
actually saying so, that he had failed in reverence
towards Heaven, and towards the Maison
de Vannes and the Maison de Creusac, in
permitting himself to offer gifts to Mdlle. de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Valogne; she recalled to him, without any
positive expression of the sort, that a young
girl of noble descent could not be approached
with gifts as a young actress might be, and
that if any had been offered they should have,
at least, been offered through herself.</p>

<p>She was honestly irritated with Othmar for
having thus been wanting, as she considered,
in full respect for those great families from
which Yseulte de Valogne had sprung. She
was excessively angry with her children&rsquo;s
governesses, whose negligence had rendered it
possible for the girl to wander about alone, and
she gave them a short but very terrible audience
in her dressing-room; yet, on the whole,
the affair amused her a little, and the high-breeding
in her made her do justice to the
honour which had forced her young cousin to
tell unasked all the truth.</p>

<p>Later on she had a little scene with her
husband, half comic, half tragic, in which they
flung the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tu quoque</i> liberally one at the other,
apropos of many vagaries less innocent than
his fancy for Yseulte de Valogne; but she did
not tell him about Othmar&rsquo;s casket, for she
reasoned, with admirable knowledge of men&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
natures, that they cared so much more if they
thought any one else cared too.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Yseulte, having given the casket
into the hands of the maid without a word or a
sign of regret, locked herself in, threw herself
on her bed, and sobbed as piteously as though
the magic box had been that of Pandora, and
bore all hope away within it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>


<p>Nadine Napraxine kept her promise to Othmar.
She did for him what she had done for no
other human being; she meditated on his
entreaties as a thing which might possibly be
granted by her. She looked for a little while
through the play and the glow of his impassioned
words as through some painted window
into some agreeable land whither, perchance,
she might travel.</p>

<p>The very sternness and daring of his manner
of demand had its attraction for her. None of
her courtiers had wooed her quite in that way:
some had been too timid, some too submissive,
some too worldly-wise. The insane desire to
fly with her from the world to some far-away,
semi-barbaric, mysterious Eden of his own
making had never been so boldly and uncompromisingly
set forth to her by any lover as
now by Othmar. It had a certain fascination
for her even while the philosophy and irony in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
her ridiculed the idea. It responded to the
vague but very real dissatisfaction with which
life, as it was, filled her. She was tired of the
routine of it. Everyone said the same thing.
Its very triumphs were so monotonous that
they might just as well have been failures.
Half her provocation and cruelty to men arose
from a wish which she could not resist, to find
something vivid and new to interest her. She
succeeded in causing tragedies, but she did not
succeed in being interested in them herself.</p>

<p>Othmar did interest her&mdash;in a measure.</p>

<p>He had done so from the first moment that
she saw him coming in&mdash;tall, slight, grave,
with great repose and more dignity than most
men of his day&mdash;through the vague light, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre
chien et loup</i>, into the hall of a country house
in the green heart of the Ardennes, where
she and her hosts and a great party, wearing
the russet and gold and pale blue of their
hunting clothes, were waiting for the signal of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curée</i> from the terraces without.</p>

<p>He had interested her then and always in a
degree; but only in a degree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It certainly cannot be love that <em>I</em> feel,&rsquo;
she said to herself, with regret. &lsquo;I am glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
when he comes because he&mdash;almost&mdash;excites
me, but I am glad when he is gone because he&mdash;almost&mdash;disturbs
me. I can imagine certain
follies being possible to me when he is here,
but they never quite become possible. If I
were sure they would become so, and in becoming
so be agreeable to me, I would go
away with him. But&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The objections seemed many to her, in a
way insuperable; they lay in herself, not in
him, and so appeared never to be removed.</p>

<p>She respected him because he would have
scorned one of those intrigues screened under
conventional observances, of which the world
is so full. If she could have entirely persuaded
herself that his life was absolutely necessary
to hers, she would not have hesitated to let
society become aware of the truth. She had no
grain in her of the hypocrite or of the coward.</p>

<p>But she was not sure: and to break up
your life irrevocably, to throw it into a furnace
and fuse it into a wholly new shape, to fling
your name to all the hounds who fed on the
offal of calumny, and then to find, after all this
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sturm und Drang</i>, that you had only made a
mistake, and were only a little more bored than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
before!&mdash;this possibility seemed to be at once
so dreary and so ridiculous that she did not
dare to put it to the proof. Her own potential
weariness in the future to which he wooed
her, rose before her in a ghastly shape and
barred the way.</p>

<p>She pondered on the matter fully and
sincerely for some days: days in which nothing
pleased her: days in which her riding-horse felt
her spurs, and her friends her sarcasms: days
in which her toilettes had little power to interest
her; Worth himself seemed worn out;
her admirable tire-woman did nothing well;
and her husband seemed to her to have grown
heavier, stouter, stupider, more Kalmuck, and
more intolerable than ever during the hours of
breakfast and dinner, which were the only
hours weighted by his presence. In those few
hours she felt almost persuaded to take her
lover at his word. Platon Napraxine was so
densely, so idiotically, so provocatively unalarmed
and secure! He would have tempted
almost any woman to make him suddenly awake
to find himself ridiculous.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He would howl like a wounded bear!&rsquo;
she thought contemptuously, &lsquo;and then some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>body
would bring him brandy, and somebody
would mention the tables, and somebody would
talk about Mdlle. Chose, and he would be all
right again. He is too stupid to feel. There
are prairie dogs, they say, which hardly know
when they are shot or beaten; he has got the
soul of one of them. Because I have married
him he is convinced that I shall never leave
him;&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la belle raison</i>! There are so many
men like that. They marry just as they buy
a cane; they put the cane in the stand; it
is bought and it cannot move; they are sure
it will always be there. One fine day some
one comes and takes it; then they stare and
they swear because they have been robbed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This time of uncertainty and doubt, which
was to Othmar fraught with such wild alternations
of hope and of fear, which now swung
him in his fancy high as heaven and now sunk
him deep in the darkness of despair, was to her
a period rather of the most minute analysis
and of the most subtle self-examination. In
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i> of her profound and unconscious
egotism she never once considered his loss or
gain: she was entirely occupied with the consideration
of her own wishes. Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
bored her; would she, if she took this step,
which to most women would have looked so
big with fate, be less bored&mdash;or more? This
seemed to her the one momentous issue which
trembled uncertain at the gate of choice.</p>

<p>She considered it thoughtfully and dispassionately.
She was not troubled by any moral
doubts, or any such reasons for hesitation as
would have beset many women of more prejudices
and of less intelligence than herself. All
these things were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le vieux jeu</i>. She was far
too clear-sighted and too highly-cultured to be
scared by such bogies as frighten narrow minds.
She saw no sanctity whatever in the marriage
ties which bound her to Platon Napraxine.
You might as well talk of a contract for eggs
and butter, or an operation on the Bourse being
sacred! No human ordinances can very well
be sacred, and we cannot be sure there are
any divine ones, logically, all the probabilities
are that there are none; so she certainly would
have said had anyone challenged her views
on such a subject.</p>

<p>In a manner, this crisis of her life amused
her like a comedy. The unconsciousness of her
husband whilst the unseen cords of destiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
were tightening about him; the revolt and
impatience of Othmar, conveyed to her by
many a restless glance and half-uttered word as
they passed each other in his drawing-rooms or
in those of others; the ignorance of her lovers
and her friends; and her own meditations as to
the many comments that the world would make
if ever it knew: all these diverted her.</p>

<p>What alone troubled her was her own pride.
Would she ever be able to endure any loss of
that? &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je serai honnête femme</i>,&rsquo; she had said
to her father in her childhood, and when she
had repeated the words in her womanhood her
mind had been made up not so much by coldness,
chastity, or delicacy as by hauteur. She
could not have endured to feel that there were
any doors in Europe which could be shut in her
face, or that she could not shut her own whensoever
and against whomsoever she might
choose.</p>

<p>His term of probation came to an end one
morning when the day had nothing of winter
save its date; a morning rosy and golden,
with distant mists transparent as a veil, and the
mild air soundless and windless amongst the
mimosa and eucalyptus groves of the grounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of La Jacquemerille. For once Nadine Napraxine
condescended to be true to an appointment;
whilst the day was still young and all
the lazy world of the modern Baiæ still dozed
or, at the utmost, yawned itself awake, she
moved, with that lovely languor which was as
much a portion of her as the breath she drew,
along the sea-terrace of her house, and smiled
to see Othmar already standing at the foot of
the sea-steps.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What children men are!&rsquo; she thought,
with that ridicule which the ardour of her
lovers was always most apt to awake in her, as
he bent over her hand and pressed on it lips
which trembled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It must be really delightful,&rsquo; she continued
in her own reflections, &lsquo;to be able to be so very
eager and so very much in earnest about anything.
Instead of abusing us, men ought to
be infinitely thankful to us for giving them
emotions which do, for the time at least eclipse
those of baccarat and of pigeon-shooting. In
a moment or two he will be inclined to hate
me, but he will be very wrong. He will always
be my debtor for fifteen days of the most exquisite
agitation of his life. Twenty years hence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he will look back to this time, and say, &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh,
le beau temps quand j&rsquo;étais si malheureux!</i>&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Whilst she so mused she was saying little
careless, easy phrases to him, pacing her terrace
slowly, with her great mantle of iris-coloured
plush, lined with silver-fox fur drawn
close about her, and its hood about her face,
like its spathe around the narcissus. She was
serene, affable, nonchalante; he was silent, and
deeply agitated; so passionately eager for his
fate to be spoken, that he could find no light
sentences with which to answer hers.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He looks very well in that kind of excitement,&rsquo;
she thought, as she glanced sideways
at him. &lsquo;He is poetic in it, instead of
being only awkward, like poor Ralph. Really,
if one could only be sure of one&rsquo;s self&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She amused herself awhile by keeping him
upon the terrace, on which all the windows
of the house looked, and where regard for her
must perforce restrain him from any betrayal of
his own emotions. She felt as if she held in
leash some panting, striving, desert animal which
she forced to preserve the measured pace and
decorous stillness of tamed creatures.</p>

<p>At length, compassion or prudence made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
her relent, and enter the little oriental room
where his eloquent avowals had been made a
fortnight before. She closed the glass doors,
threw off her furs, and stood in the subdued
light and the heated air of the room, cool,
pale, delicate as the April flower which she
resembled, long trailing folds of the primrose-coloured
satin which formed her morning
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">négligé</i> falling from her throat to her feet in
the long lines that painters love; one great
pearl fastened a few sprays of stephanotis at
her throat. She sank into a chair which stood
against a tree of scarlet azalea set in an antique
vase of brass. She was one of those women
who naturally make pictures of themselves for
every act and in every attitude.</p>

<p>The moment they were secure from observation
Othmar knelt at her feet and kissed
her hands again; his eyes, uplifted, told their
tale of rapture, hope, fear, and imploring
prayer more passionately than any words. He
would have cut his heart out of his breast if
she had bidden him.</p>

<p>She glanced down on the agitation which
his features could not conceal with a sense of
that wonder which never failed to come to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
before the intensity of feeling with which she
inspired others.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When I really do nothing to make them
like that!&rsquo; she reflected for the hundredth
time before the tempest which she raised
almost without endeavour.</p>

<p>Othmar had recovered his presence of mind,
though none of his tranquillity; his words,
impetuous, persuasive, at times broken by the
force of his emotion, at times eloquent with
the eloquence natural to passion, fell on her
ear uninterrupted by her. She listened, much
as she might have listened to the sonorous
swell of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marche au Supplice</i> of Berlioz, or
any other harmony which should have pleased
her taste if only by contrast of its own vehemence
and strength with the serenity of her
own nature. She listened, without any sign of
any sort, save of so much acquiescence as might
be indicated by the gentleness of her expression
and the passiveness with which she left her
hand in his. He believed her silence to be
assent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is what I have always fancied might
conquer me,&rsquo; she thought, whilst his ardent
protestations and entreaties held her for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
moment pleased and fascinated. &lsquo;And yet, I
do not know. To leave the world, to be always
together, to go, heaven knows where, into a sort
of Mahometan paradise&mdash;would it suit me? I
am afraid not. The idea pleases one in a
way, but not quite enough for that. Always
together, and alone&mdash;one would tire of an
angel!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So still she was, as these thoughts drifted
through her mind, so unresistingly she let his
forehead, and then his lips, lie on her hand,
that he believed himself successful in his prayer.
He lifted his eyes and looked at her with a
gaze full of rapturous light, of adoration and
of gratitude.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my love! my love!&rsquo; he murmured.
&lsquo;Never shall you regret an hour your mercy to
me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>His lips would have sought hers as his
words ended in a sigh, the lover&rsquo;s sigh of happiness,
but she moved and disengaged herself
quickly, and motioned to him to rise. On her
mouth there was the slight smile he knew so
well&mdash;the smile that was the enemy of men.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear friend,&rsquo; she said, in her melodious
voice, sweet as the south wind, and never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
sweeter than when it uttered cruel truths to
ears that were wounded by them, &lsquo;I will do
you the justice to grant that I quite believe
you care very much for me&rsquo; (he made an indignant
gesture); &lsquo;well, that you love me <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un
peu, beaucoup, passionnément</i>, as the convent
girls say to the daisies. But I am equally convinced
that you do not understand me in the
least. I understand myself thoroughly. We
are all enigmas to others, but we ought to be
able to read our own riddle ourselves. I can
read mine; many people never can read theirs
all their lives long, and that is why they make
so many mistakes. Now, I do know myself so
very well. I know that no kind of sin, if there
really be such a thing as sin, would frighten
me much. I think my nerves would stand
even a crime without wincing, if it were a bold
one. If the world threw stones at me, it would
amuse me. I cannot fancy anybody being unhappy
about it. Therefore you will comprehend
me when I say that it is not any kind of
commonplace nonsense about doing anything
wrong which moves me for a moment, but,&mdash;I
have thought of it all very much and very
seriously, and really with a wish to try that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
other kind of life you speak of, but&mdash;I cannot
go with you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She said it as quietly and as lightly as if she
were saying that she could not drive with him
to the Col di Guardia that morning. She was
smiling her pretty, slight, mysterious smile,
which might have meant anything, from pity to
derision. She had a sprig or two of the leafless
calycanthus in her fingers, which she played
with as she spoke. He hated the fragrance of
that winter blossom ever afterwards.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You cannot? You cannot?&rsquo; he murmured
almost unconsciously. &lsquo;And why?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He did not well know what he said, the
paralysis of a sudden and intense disappointment
was upon him; he forgot that he had no
right to interrogate her, that no faintest breath
of promise from her had ever given him title
to upbraid her; the noise as of a million waves
of stormy seas was surging in his ears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo; she repeated, with the same serenity,
and with a kind of indulgence as to a wayward,
imperious child. &lsquo;Oh, for so many
reasons!&mdash;not at all, believe me, from any kind
of hesitation about Platon; he would do very
well without me, though he would try to kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
you, I suppose, because men have such odd
ideas; besides they are always fretting about
what the world thinks, just as when they play
billiards they think about the opinion of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">galerie</i>; no, not for that, believe me; that is
not my kind of feeling at all; but I have
thought over it all very much, and I have decided
that it would not do&mdash;for me. I should
be irritable and unhappy in a false position,
because I should have lost the power to shut
my doors, other people would shut theirs instead;
I should be quite miserable if I could
not be disagreeable to persons whom I did not
care to know, and no one in a false position
ever dares be that; they smile, poor creatures,
perpetually, like so many wax dolls from
Giroux&rsquo;s. Of course the moral people say it
is the loss of self-respect which makes them
so anxious to please, but it is not that: it is
really the sense that it is of no use for them
to be rude any more, because their rudeness
cannot vex anybody. I quite understand Marie
Antoinette; I should not mind the scaffold in
the least, but I should dislike going in the cart.
&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le roi avait une charrette</i>,&rdquo; you remember.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar had risen; as she glanced up at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
him, even over her calm and courageous temperament,
a little chill passed that was almost
one of alarm. Yet her sense of pleasure was
keener than her fear: men&rsquo;s souls were the
chosen instrument on which she chose to play;
if here she struck some deeper chords than
usual, the melody gained for her ear. Profound
emotions and eager passions were unknown
to her in her own person, but they
constituted a spectacle which diverted her if it
did not weary her&mdash;the chances depended upon
her mood. At this moment they pleased her;
pleased her the more for that thrill of alarm,
which was so new to her nerves.</p>

<p>Othmar did not speak: all the strength
which was in him was taxed to its breaking
point in the effort to restrain the passionate
reproaches and entreaties which sprang to his
lips, the burning tears of bitter disillusion and
cruel disappointment which rushed to his sight
and oppressed his breath. What a fool, what
a madman, he had been again to throw down
his heart like a naked, trembling, panting thing
at her feet to be played with by her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How well he looks like that!&rsquo; she thought.
&lsquo; Most men grow red when they are so angry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
but he grows like marble, and his eyes burn&mdash;there
are great tears in them&mdash;he looks like
Mounet-Sully as Hippolytus.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Once more the momentary inclination came
over her to trust herself to that stormy force
of love which might lead to shipwreck and
might lead to paradise; there were a beauty, a
force, a fascination for her about him as he
stood there in his silent rage, his eyes pouring
down on her the lightnings of his reproach; but
the impulse was not strong enough to conquer
her; the world she would have given up with
contemptuous indifference, but she would not
surrender her own power to dictate to the world.</p>

<p>Her soft tranquil voice went on, as a waterfall
may gently murmur its silvery song while
a tempest shakes the skies.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know you think that love is enough, but
I assure you I should doubt it, even if I did&mdash;love
you. Rousseau has said long before us
that love lacks two things,&mdash;permanence and
immutability; they seem to me synonymous,
and I do not think that their absence is a defect;
I think it even a merit. Yet, as they <em>are</em> absent,
it cannot be worth while to pay so very much
for so very defective a thing.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;God forgive you!&rsquo; cried her lover in passionate
pain. &lsquo;You betray me with the cruelest
jest that woman ever played off on man,
and you think that I can stand still to hearken
to the pretty tinkling bells of a drawing-room
philosophy!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You do not stand still,&rsquo; she answered languidly,
&lsquo;you walk to and fro like a wounded
panther in a cage. I have in no way betrayed
you, and I am not jesting at all. I am saying
the very simplest truth. You have asked me
to do a momentous and irrevocable thing; and
I have answered you truthfully that I should
not shrink from it if I were convinced that I
should never regret it. But I am not convinced&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you loved me you would be so!&rsquo; he
said in a voice which was choked and almost
inaudible.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&mdash;if!&rsquo; said Nadine Napraxine with a
smile and a little sigh. &lsquo;The whole secret lies
in that one conjunction!&rsquo;</p>

<p>His teeth clenched as he heard her as if in
the intolerable pain of some mortal wound.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Besides, besides,&rsquo; she murmured, half to
herself and half to him, &lsquo;my dear Othmar, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
are charming. You are like no one else; you
please me; I confess that you please me, but
you could not ensure me against my own unfortunate
capacity for very soon tiring of
everybody, and,&mdash;I have a conviction that
in three months&rsquo; time <em>I should be tired of
you</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>A strong shudder passed over him from
head to foot, as the words struck him with a
greater shock than the blow of a dagger in his
side would have given. He realised the bottomless
gulf which separated him from the woman
he adored,&mdash;the chasm of her own absolute
indifference.</p>

<p>He, in his exaltation, was ready to give up
all his future and fling away all his honour for
her sake, and would have asked nothing more of
earth and heaven than to have passed life and
eternity at her feet; and she, swayed momentarily
towards him by a faint impulse of the
senses and the sensibilities, yet could draw back
and calmly look outward into that vision of
the possible future, which dazzled him as the
mirage blinds and mocks the desert-pilgrim
dying of thirst; she, with chill prescience could
foresee the time when his presence would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
become to her a weariness, a chain, a yoke-fellow
tiresome and dull!</p>

<p>She looked at him with a momentary compassion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear Othmar, I am quite sure you have
meant all you said,&rsquo; she murmured softly.
&lsquo;But, believe me, it would not do; it would
not do for you and me, if it might for some
people. I am not in the least shocked. I
think your idea quite beautiful, like a poem;
but I am certain it would never suit myself.
I tire of everything so quickly, and then you
know I am not in love with <em>you</em>. One wants
to be so much in love to do that sort of thing,
we should bore one another so infinitely after
the first week. Yes, I am sure we should,
though I know you are quite sincere in saying
you would like it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then, still with that demure, satisfied,
amused smile, she turned away and lifted up
the Moorish chocolate pot and poured out a
little chocolate into her cup.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It has grown cold,&rsquo; she said, and tinkled
a hand-bell which was on the tray to summon
Mahmoud.</p>

<p>Othmar, who had sprung to his feet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
stood erect, seized her wrist in his fingers and
threw the bell aside.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is no need to dismiss me,&rsquo; he said in
a low tone. &lsquo;Adieu! You can tell the story
to Lord Geraldine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His face was quite colourless, except that
around his forehead there was a dusky red
mark where the blood had surged and settled
as though he had been struck there with a
whip.</p>

<p>He bowed low, and left her.</p>

<p>She stood before the Moorish tray and its
contents with a sense of cold at her heart, but
her little self-satisfied smile was still on her
mouth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He will come back,&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;He
came back before; they always come back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She did not intend to go with him to Asia,
but she did not, either, intend to lose him altogether.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He was superb in his fury and his grief,&rsquo;
she thought, &lsquo;and he meant every word of it,
and he would do all that he said, more than
he said. Perhaps it hurt him too much, perhaps
I laughed a little too soon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She was like the child who had found its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
living bird the best of all playthings, but
had forgotten that its plaything, being alive,
could also die, and so had nipped the new toy
too cruelly in careless little fingers, and had
killed it.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Othmar, as he left La Jacquemerille, forgot
the boat in which he had come thither. He
walked mechanically through the house, and
out by the first gate which he saw before him.
He was in that state of febrile excitation in
which the limbs move without the will in an
instinctive effort to find outlet to mental pain
in bodily exertion. The gate he had passed
through opened into a little wood of pines,
whence a narrow path led upward into the
hills above. With little consciousness of what
he did, he ascended the mule-road which rose
before him, and the chill of the morning air,
as it blew through the tops of the swaying
pines, was welcome to him. He had that cruel
wound within him which a proud man suffers
from when he has disclosed the innermost secrets
of his heart in a rare moment of impulse, and
has seen them lightly and contemptuously
played with for a jest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>He had gone through life receiving much
adulation but little sympathy, and giving as
little confidence; in a moral isolation due to the
delicacy of his own nature and to the flattery
he received, which had early made him withhold
himself from intimate friendships, fearing
to trust where he would be only duped.</p>

<p>To her, in an unguarded hour, he had
shown the loneliness and the longing which he
felt, he had disclosed the empty place which
no powers or vanities of the world could fill;
he had staked the whole of his peace on the
caprice of one woman, and he knew that, in
the rough phrase which men would have used
to him, he had been made a fool of in return;
he had betrayed himself, and had nothing in
return but the memory of a little low laughter,
of a tranquil voice, saying: &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout cela c&rsquo;est le
vieux jeu!</i>&rsquo;</p>

<p>He never knew very well how that day of
the 2nd of January passed with him. He was
sensible of walking long, of climbing steep
paths going towards the higher mountains,
of drinking thirstily at a little woodland fountain,
of sitting for hours quite motionless, looking
down on the shore far below, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
blue sea spread in the sunlight, and the towers
of S. Pharamond were mere grey points amidst
a crowd of evergreen and of silvery-leafed
trees.</p>

<p>There was an irony in the sense that he
could have purchased the whole province which
lay beneath his feet, could have bought out the
princeling who reigned in that little kingdom
under old Turbia, as easily as he could have
bought a bouquet for a woman, could have set
emperors to war with one another by merely
casting his gold into the scales of peace,
could have created a city in a barren plain with
as little effort as a child builds up a toy village
on a table, and yet was powerless to command,
or to arouse, the only thing on earth which he
desired, one whit of feeling in the woman he
loved!</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when he
took his way homeward, having eaten nothing,
only drunk thirstily of water wherever a little
brook had made a well amongst the tufts of
hepatica in the pine woods. He was a man
capable of a spiritual love; if she had remained
aloof from him for honour&rsquo;s sake, but had
cared for him, he would not have demurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
to her choice, but would have accepted his fate
at her hands and would have served her loyally
with the devotion of a chivalrous nature.</p>

<p>All the passion, the pain, as of a boy&rsquo;s first
love, blent in him with the bitter revolts of
mature manhood. He believed that Nadine
Napraxine had never intended more than to
amuse herself with his rejection; he believed
that for the second time he had been the toy
of an unscrupulous coquette. Whatever fault
there might be in his love for her, it was love&mdash;absolute,
strong, faithful, and capable of an
eternal loyalty; he had laid his heart bare
before her, and had meant in their utmost
meaning all the words which he had uttered,
all the offers which he had made. Despite
his knowledge of her, he had allowed himself
to be beguiled into a second confession
of the empire she possessed over him, and
for the second time he had been not alone
rejected, but gently ridiculed with that quiet
amused irony which had been to the force
and heat of his passion like a fine spray of
ice-cold water falling on iron at a white-heat.
She had not alone wounded and stung
him: she had humiliated him profoundly. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
she had rejected him from honour, duty, or
love for any other, he would have borne what
men have borne a thousand times in silence,
and with no sense of shame; but he was conscious
that in her absolute indifference she
had drawn him on to the fullest revelation of
all he felt for her, only that her ready satire
might find food in his folly, and her fine wit
play with his suffering, as the angler plays
the trout. She seemed to him to have betrayed
him in the basest manner that a woman could
betray a man who had no positive right to her
loyalty. She had known so well how he loved
her. He had told her so many times; unless
she had been willing to hear the tale again,
why had she bidden him come there in that
charmed solitude in the hush and freshness of
the early morning? When women desire not
love, do they seat their lover beside them
when all the world sleeps? He had been
cheated, laughed at, summoned, and then dismissed;
his whole frame thrilled with humiliation
when he recalled the smiling subdued
mockery of her voice as she had dismissed
him.</p>

<p>He had been willing to give her his life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
his good repute, his peace, his honour, his very
soul; and she had sent him away with the
calm, cool, little phrases with which she would
have rejected a clumsy valser for a cotillon!</p>

<p>He had little vanity, but he knew himself
to be one of those to whom the world cringes;
one of those of whom modern life has made
its Cæsars; he knew that what he had been
willing to surrender to her had been no little
thing; that he would have said farewell to
the whole of mankind for her sake, and would
have loved her with the romantic devoted force
and fealty of a franker and fiercer time than his
own; and she had drawn him on to again
confess this, again offer this, and all it had
seemed to her was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux jeu</i>, an archaic thing
to laugh at, to yawn at, to be indulgent to, and
tired by, in a breath!</p>

<p>He was a very proud man, and a man who
had seldom or never shown what he either
desired or suffered, yet he had laid his whole
heart bare to her; and she, the only living
being who had either power over him, or real
knowledge of him, had looked at him with her
little cool smile, and said, &lsquo;In three months I
should be tired of you.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>If, when the knight had killed his falcon for
his lady, she had scoffed at it and thrown it out
to feed the rats and sparrows he would have
suffered as Othmar suffered now. He had killed
his honour and his pride for her sake, and she
had held them in her hands for a moment, and
then had laughed a little and had thrown them
away.</p>

<p>Where he sat all alone he felt his cheeks
burn with the sense of an unendurable mortification.
At this moment, for aught he knew,
she, with her admirable mimicry and her
merciless sarcasm, might be reacting the scene
for the diversion of her companions! Passion
was but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux jeu</i>; it could expect no higher
distinction than to be ridiculed as comedy by a
witty woman. Did not the universe only exist
to amuse the languor of Nadine Napraxine?</p>

<p>The world, had it heard the story, would
have blamed him for an unholy love, and
praised her for her dismissal of it; but he
knew that he had been as utterly betrayed as
though he had been sold by her into the hands
of assassins. She had drawn him on, and on,
and on, until all his life had been laid at her
feet, and then she had looked at it a little, care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>lessly,
idly, and had said she had no use for it,
as she might have said so of any sea-waste
washed up on the sea-steps of her terrace with
that noon.</p>

<p>Of course the world would have praised
her; no doubt the world would have blamed
him; but he knew that women who slay their
lovers after loving them do a coarser but a
kinder thing.</p>

<p>It was almost dark as he descended the road
to S. Pharamond, intending when he reached
home to make some excuse to his uncle and
leave for Paris by the night express or by a
special train. The path he took led through
the orange-wood of Sandroz, which fitted, in a
triangular-shaped piece of ground, between the
boundaries of his own land and that of Millo.
Absorbed as he was in his own thoughts, he recognised
with surprise the figure of Yseulte as he
pushed his way under the low boughs of the
orange trees, and saw her within a yard of him.
She was with the woman Nicole.</p>

<p>She did not see him until he was close to
her, where she sat on a low stone wall, the
woman standing in front of her. When she did
so, her face spoke for her; it said what Nadine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Napraxine&rsquo;s had never said. The emotion of
joy and timidity mingled touched him keenly
in that moment, when he, with his millions of
gold and of friends, had so strongly realised his
own loneliness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>She</em> loves me as much as she dare&mdash;as
much as she can, without being conscious of
it,&rsquo; he thought, as he paused beside her. She
did not speak, she did not move; but her
colour changed and her breath came quickly.
She had slipped off the wall and stood irresolute,
as though inclined to run away, the glossy
leaves and the starry blossoms of the trees
consecrated to virginity were all above her and
around her. She glanced at him with an
indefinite fear; she fancied he was angered by
the return of the casket; he looked paler and
sterner than she had ever seen him look.</p>

<p>He paused a moment and said some commonplace
word.</p>

<p>Then he saw that her eyes were wet with
tears, and that she had been crying.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; he said, gently.
&lsquo;Has anything vexed you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They are sending her away,&rsquo; said Nicole
Sandroz, with indignant tears in her own eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
finding that she did not reply for herself.
&lsquo;They are sending her to the Vosges, where, as
Monsieur knows very well, I make no doubt,
the very hares and wolves are frozen in the
woods at this month of the year.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you indeed going away?&rsquo; he asked of
Yseulte herself.</p>

<p>She did not speak: she made a little affirmative
gesture.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why is that? Bois le Roy, in this season,
will be a cruel prison for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My cousin wishes it,&rsquo; said the girl; she
spoke with effort; she did not wish to cry
before him; the memory of all that her cousin
had said that morning was with her in merciless
distinctness.</p>

<p>Nicole broke out in a torrent of speech,
accusing the tyrants of Millo in impassioned
and immoderate language, and devoting them
and theirs to untold miseries in retribution.</p>

<p>Yseulte stopped her with authority; &lsquo;You
are wrong, Nicole; do not speak in such a
manner, it is insolent. You forget that, whether
I am in the Vosges or here, I equally owe my
cousin everything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She paused; she was no more than a child.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Her departure was very cruel to her; she had
been humiliated and chastised that day beyond
her power of patience; she had said nothing,
done nothing, but in her heart she had rebelled
passionately when they had taken away her
ivory casket. They had left her the heart of
a woman in its stead.</p>

<p>Othmar was ignorant that his casket, fateful
as Pandora&rsquo;s, had been returned, but he
divined that his gift had displeased those who
disposed of her destiny, and had brought about
directly or indirectly her exile from Millo.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When do you go?&rsquo; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To-morrow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As she answered him the tears she could
not altogether restrain rolled off her lashes.
She turned away.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let us go in, Nicole,&rsquo; she murmured. &lsquo;You
know Henriette is waiting for me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let her wait, the cockered-up Parisienne,
who shrieks if she see a pig and has hysterics
if she get a spot of mud on her stockings!&rsquo;
grumbled Nicole, who was the sworn foe of
the whole Paris-born and Paris-bred household
of Millo. But Yseulte had already moved
towards the house. When she had gone a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
yards away, however, she paused, returned, and
approached Othmar. She looked on the ground,
and her voice trembled as she spoke: &lsquo;I ought
to thank you, M. Othmar&mdash;I do thank you. It
was very beautiful. I would have kept it all
my life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Othmar.</p>

<p>He understood; he was moved to a sudden
anger, which penetrated even his intense preoccupation.
He had meant to do this poor
child a kindness, and he had only done her
great harm.</p>

<p>Yseulte had turned away, and had gone
rapidly through the orange-trees towards the
house.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She is not happy?&rsquo; said Othmar to her
foster-mother, whose tongue, once loosed, told
him with the eloquence of indignation of all
the sorrows suffered by her nursling. &lsquo;And
they will make her a nun, Monsieur!&rsquo; she
cried; &lsquo;a nun! That child, who is like a June
lily. For me, I say nothing against the black
and grey women, though Sandroz calls them
bad names. There are good women amongst
them, and when one lies sick in hospital one is
glad of them; but there are women enough in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
this world who have sins and shame to repent
them of to fill all the convents from here to
Jerusalem. There are all the ugly ones too,
and the sickly ones and the deformed ones,
and the heart-broken; for them it is all very
well; the cloister is home, the veil is peace,
they must think of heaven, or go mad; it is
best they should think of it. But this child to
be a nun!&mdash;when she should be running with
her own children through the daisies&mdash;when
she should be playing in the sunshine like the
lambs, like the kids, like the pigeons!&rsquo; &mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Othmar heard her to the end; then without
answer he bade her good-day, and
descended the sloping grass towards his house.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They say he has a million a year,&rsquo; said
Nicole to herself, as she looked after him.
&lsquo;Well, he does not seem to be happy upon it.
The lads that bring up the rags on their heads
from the ships look gayer than he, all in the
stench and the muck as they are, and never
knowing that they will earn their bread and
wine from one day to another.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She kicked a stone from her path, and
hurried after her nursling.</p>

<p>Othmar went quickly on to his own woods.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
&lsquo;They could not even let her have that toy,&rsquo;
he thought with an emotion, vague but sincere,
outside the conflict of passion, wrath, and mortification
which Nadine Napraxine had aroused
in him. He saw the sudden happiness, so soon
veiled beneath reserve and timidity, which had
shone on the girl&rsquo;s face as she had first seen him
under the orange boughs. He saw her beautiful
golden eyes misty with the tears she had had
too much courage to shed; he saw her slender
throat swell with subdued emotion as she had
approached him and said shyly, &lsquo;I would have
kept it all my life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>All her life,&mdash;in the stone cell of some
house of the Daughters of Christ or the Sisters
of St. Marie!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&lsquo;To love is more, yet to be loved is something,&rsquo;</p></div>

<p>he thought. &lsquo;What treasures for one&rsquo;s heart
and senses are in her&mdash;if one could only care!&rsquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>When he reached home that evening he found
on his writing-table the ivory casket and the
letter of Madame de Vannes. In the pain and
the passion which wrestled together against his
manhood in him, he scarcely heeded either, yet
they brought before his memory the face of
Yseulte, and the sound of her soft grave voice
with that sweet thrill of youth in it which is
like the thrill of the thrush&rsquo;s in the woods at
spring-time. She had youth, but she would
have no spring-time.</p>

<p>And in the strong and impotent rage which
consumed him, in the pain of bruised and
aching nerves, and the sickening void which
the certain loss of what alone is loved brings with
it, Othmar, seeing the ivory casket, and glancing
at the letter which he had had no patience to
read through, thought to himself, &lsquo;The child
loves me; she will have a wretched life; what
if I try to forget? They threw virgins to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Minotaur. Shall I try to appease with one this
cruel fire of love, which leaves me no peace or
wisdom?&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was the act of a madman to attempt to
make one woman take the place of another
to the senses or to the heart, but in that
moment he was not master of himself. He
was only sensible of a cruel insult which he
had received from the hand he loved best on
earth; of a cruel betrayal which was but the
more merciless because wrought with so sweet a
smile, so apparent an unconsciousness, so seemingly
innocent a malice.</p>

<p>He passed the night and the next morning
locked in his own room; when he left it, and
met the Baron Friederich, he said to him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have thought over all you said the other
day. You are right, no doubt. Will you go
across to our neighbours at Millo and ask of
them the honour of the hand of their cousin,
of Mademoiselle de Valogne?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Baron stared at him with a little cry of
amaze.</p>

<p>&lsquo;For you?&rsquo; he stammered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;For me,&rsquo; said Othmar. &lsquo;What have you
said yourself? I do not want wealth; I want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
good blood, beauty, and innocence; they are
all possessed by Mademoiselle de Valogne. Go;
your errand will please them. They will
pardon some breach of etiquette. It will be a
mission which you will like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the Baron, a little later, rolled through
the gates of Millo in full state, his shrewd
knowledge of men and their madnesses made
him think:</p>

<p>&lsquo;So the Princess Napraxine evidently will
have nothing to say to him! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A la bonne heure!</i>
There are some honest women left then amongst
the great ladies. She could so easily have
ruined him! He takes a droll way to cure
himself, but it is not a bad one. The worst is,
that this sort of cure never lasts long, and when
she can make the unhappiness of two persons,
instead of only the happiness of one, perhaps
Madame la Princesse will be tempted to make
it!&rsquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
</div>


<p>On the following day Platon Napraxine drove
home from Monte Carlo at sunset with a
piece of news to carry there which amused
and unusually animated him.</p>

<p>He went up the stone stairs of the terrace
of La Jacquemerille with the quick step of one
who is eager to deliver himself of his tidings,
and approached, with a rapidity unfrequent
with him, the spot where his wife sat with
her guests under the rose and white awning
beside the marble balustrade and the variegated
aloes.</p>

<p>The Princess Nadine was also full of unwonted
animation; her cheek had its sea-shell
flush, her eyes a vague and pleased expectancy;
she was laughing a little and listening a good
deal; besides her usual companions, she had
there a group of Austrian and Russian
diplomatists and some Parisian boulevardiers.
They were just taking their leave as she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
taking her tea, but it was not very greatly of
them that she was thinking: she was thinking
as she heard the roll of her husband&rsquo;s carriage
wheels beneath the carouba trees;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;Ten to
one Othmar will return with him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She lost her gay expression as she saw that
he was alone.</p>

<p>All the day she had expected the man whom
she had banished to return. She was accustomed
to spaniels who crawled humbly up after
a beating to solicit another beating rather than
remain unnoticed. She had dismissed a certain
apprehension which had told her that she had
gone too far with the reflection that a man
who loved her once did so for ever, and that,
as he had returned from Asia, so he would
return this morning, however great his offence
or his humiliation might have been.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is more romantic than most,&rsquo; she had
thought, &lsquo;but after all, he must be made of the
same stuff.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Napraxine approached her hurriedly, and
scarcely giving himself time to formally greet
the gentlemen there, cried to her aloud:</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ecoutez donc, Madame!</i> You will never
guess what has happened.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;It is of no use for us to try then,&rsquo; said his
wife. &lsquo;You are evidently <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gonflé</i> with some
tremendous intelligence. Pray unburden yourself.
Perhaps the societies for the protection of
animals have had Strasburg <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâtés</i> made illegal?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have seen the Duchesse, I have seen
Baron Fritz, I have seen Melville,&rsquo; answered
her husband impetuously and triumphantly,
&lsquo;and they all say the same thing, so that there
cannot be a doubt that it is true. Othmar
marries that little cousin of Cri-Cri: the one
of whom they meant to make a nun. What
luck for her! But they say she is very beautiful,
and only sixteen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The people assembled round her table
raised a chorus of exclamation and of comment.
Napraxine stood amidst them, delighted; his
little social bomb had burst with the brilliancy
and the noise that he had anticipated.</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine turned her head with an
involuntary movement of surprise.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar!&rsquo; she repeated; her large black
eyes opened fully with a perplexed expression.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It must be the girl who was in the boat,&rsquo;
said Lady Brancepeth. &lsquo;She was very handsome.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Geraldine looked at Madame Napraxine
with curiosity, eagerness, and gratification.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who told you, Platon?&rsquo; she asked, with
a certain impatience in her voice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Three of them told me; Melville first,
then Cri-Cri herself, in the Salle de Jeu.
She did not seem to know whether to be
affronted or pleased. She said the whole thing
was a great surprise, but that she could not
refuse Othmar; she declared that her projects
were all upset, that her young cousin had been
always destined to the religious life; that she
regretted to have her turned from her vocation;
in short, she talked a great deal of nonsense,
but the upshot of it all was that Baron Fritz had
made formal proposals, and that she had accepted
them. In the gardens, coming away, I met
the Baron himself; he was in a state of ecstasy;
all he cares for is the perpetuation of the name
of Othmar; but he declares that Mademoiselle
de Valogne is everything he could desire, that
she was excessively timid, and scarcely spoke
a word when they allowed him to see her for
five minutes, but that it was a very graceful
timidity, and full of feeling.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Baron Fritz in the operatic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of Padrone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
d&rsquo;Amore is infinitely droll,&rsquo; said Nadine, with a
little cold laugh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course Othmar was obliged to marry
some time,&rsquo; continued Napraxine, who did not
easily abandon a subject when one pleased him.
&lsquo;And he is&mdash;how old is he?&mdash;I saw the Baron
as I left; he is delighted. He says the poor
child fainted when they told her she was to be
saved from a religious life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Platon,&rsquo; said his wife impatiently,
&lsquo; we can read Daudet or Henri Greville when
we want this sort of thing. Pray, spare us.
I hope Baron Fritz explained to her that all
she is wanted for is to continue a race of
Croatian money-lenders which he considers the
pivot of the world. If she fail in doing that
he will counsel a divorce, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la</i> Bonaparte.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He might marry an archduchess,&rsquo; said one
of the diplomatists. &lsquo;Surely, it is throwing
himself away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It must be for love,&rsquo; said Geraldine, with
an ironical smile.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The de Valogne was a great race, but
impoverished long ago,&rsquo; said a Russian minister.
&lsquo; I think, if he had married at all, he should
have made an alliance which would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
brought him that unassailably great rank which
is usually the ambition of all financiers. For
a man of his position to make a mere romantic
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mariage d&rsquo;amour</i> is absurd&mdash;out of place;&mdash;and
who knows if it be even that?&rsquo; he pursued,
with an involuntary glance at the Princess
Napraxine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why on earth should we doubt it?&rsquo; said
her husband. &lsquo;It cannot be anything else,
and they say the girl is quite beautiful.
Surely, if anyone can afford to marry to
please himself, that one is Othmar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At any rate, it is his own affair,&rsquo; said
Nadine, in a voice which was clear and sweet,
but cold as steel. &lsquo;I cannot see why we should
occupy ourselves about it, or why you should
have announced it as if it were the dissolution
of the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mademoiselle de Valogne is very beautiful,&rsquo;
said Geraldine, &lsquo;I have seen her once at Millo.
Why should they pretend to hesitate?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They hesitated because she is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vouée à
Marie</i>,&rsquo; replied Napraxine, &lsquo;and also the de
Vannes and the de Creusac scarcely recognise
the princes of finance as their equals. Still
the marriage is magnificent; they felt they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
had no right to regret it since it fell to them
from heaven.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you still believe, Platon, that heaven
has anything to do with marriage?&rsquo; said his
wife, with her little significant smile; a slight
colour had come upon her cheeks, tinging
them as blush-roses are tinged with the faintest
flush; her eyes retained their astonished and
annoyed expression, of which her husband saw
nothing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Heaven made mine at least,&rsquo; he said, with
his unfailing good-humour, and a bow in which
there was some grace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Louis Quatorze could not have answered
better,&rsquo; said Nadine. &lsquo;I cannot say I see the
hand of heaven myself in it, but if you do,
so much the better. "Les illusions sont des
zéros, mais c&rsquo;est avec les zéros qu&rsquo;on fait les
beaux chiffres."&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not know whether Mademoiselle de
Valogne has illusions, but her settlements will
certainly have <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de beaux chiffres</i>,&rsquo; continued
Napraxine, who was still full of the tidings he
had brought. &lsquo;Did Othmar say nothing to
you the other morning of what he intended
to do?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing; why should he? I am no
relation of his or of Mademoiselle de Valogne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He might have done so; he was a long
time alone with you. Perhaps he did not know
it himself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It seems a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de tête</i>. Madame de
Vannes told me that he had only seen her
cousin four times.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is three times more than is necessary.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They say the girl is very much in love
with him, and burst into tears when they
told her of his proposals.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear Platon! That the girl
marries Othmar one understands; she would
be an imbecile, a lunatic, to refuse; but that
she weeps because she will enjoy one of the
hugest fortunes in Europe&mdash;do not make such
demands on our credulity!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They say their acquaintance has been an
idyl; quite <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors d&rsquo;usage</i>; they both met in
his gardens by chance, and he&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Chance? I thought it was heaven? You
may be quite sure neither had anything to do
with it. Aurore is a very clever woman; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
knew very well what she did when she brought
her cousin down to Millo this winter; if the
girl had been honestly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vouée à Marie</i>, would
they have had her in the drawing-room after
their dinner-parties? Ralph says he has seen
her there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, if it were a conspiracy, it has succeeded.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course it has succeeded. When women
condescend to conspire, men always fall. Our
Russian history will show you that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Being, however, an obstinate man, who
always adhered to his own opinion, even in
trifles which in no way concerned him, Napraxine
reiterated that Baron Fritz had expressed
himself satisfied that the girl was in
love with his nephew.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And why not?&rsquo; he said stoutly, with more
courage than he usually showed. &lsquo;Most women
would soon care for Othmar if he wished them
to do so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand dada</i>!&rsquo; murmured Nadine, in
supreme disdain, whilst her eyes glanced over
him for a moment with an expression which,
had he been wise enough to read it, would
have made him less eager to extol the absent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;After all,&rsquo; she said aloud, &lsquo;what is his marriage
to us, that we should talk about it? I
suppose it is the sole act of his life which
would have no effect on the Bourses. We get
into very base habits of discussing our neighbours&rsquo;
affairs. Let us say, once for all, that
he has done a very charitable action, and that
we hope it will have a happy result: <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">e basta!</i>
We will call at Millo to-morrow. I am curious
to see the future Countess Othmar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They say she is very shy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, we all know Ste. Mousseline,&rsquo; said
Nadine Napraxine, with scorn. &lsquo;Besides, convent-reared
girls are all of the same type. I
only hope Cri-Cri will not assume any hypocritical
airs of regret before me; the only regret
she can really have is that Blanchette was
not old enough to have won this matrimonial
Derby.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You always speak so slightingly of Othmar,&rsquo;
said Napraxine, with some reproach.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I really thought I paid him a high compliment,&rsquo;
said his wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why has he done it?&rsquo; said one of the
Russian diplomatists to another, when they
had taken leave of the Princess and her party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;I imagine that Madame Napraxine piqued
him,&rsquo; said another. &lsquo;You know he has been
madly in love with her for two years.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She does not seem to like his marriage.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They never like it,&rsquo; returned the Russian
minister. &lsquo;They may not look at you themselves,
but they never like you to look at any
one else.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If he marry her because he is in love elsewhere,
and if she have the Princess Nadine for
an enemy at the onset, this poor child&rsquo;s path
will not be of roses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She will be almost the richest woman in
Europe; that must suffice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That will depend on her character.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It will depend a little on whether she will
be in love with her husband. If she be not, all
may go smoothly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you know what I thought as I looked
at Madame Napraxine just now?&rsquo; said the
younger man. &lsquo;I thought of that Persian or
Indian tale where the woman, leaning over
the magic cup, dropped a pearl from her necklace
into it, and spoilt the whole charm for all
eternity. I dare say it will be only a pearl
which she will drop into Othmar&rsquo;s future life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
but it will spoil the whole charm of it for ever
and ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You never liked her,&rsquo; said the elder man.
&lsquo;She is a woman capable of an infinitude of
things, good and bad. She has the misfortune
to have a very excellent and very stupid husband.
There is nothing so injurious for a
clever woman. A bad man who had ill-treated
her would not have done her half as much
harm. She would have had courage and energy
to meet an unhappy fate superbly. But a perfectly
amiable fool whom she disdains from all
the height of her own admirable wit, coupled
with the habits of our idiotic world, which is
like a mountain of wool steeped in opium, into
which the strongest sinks indolent and enfeebled,
have all tended to confirm her in her egotism
and her disdain, and to send to sleep all her
more noble impulses. Whatever men may be,
women can only be &ldquo;saved by faith,&rdquo; and what
faith has Nadine Napraxine except her perfect
faith in her own irresistible and incomparable
power over her innumerable lovers?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the younger man, &lsquo;if she chose
to drop that pearl in, as I said, I would not
give much for the chances of Othmar&rsquo;s wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
against her. I have seen the girl. She is very
lovely, serious, simple; no match at all against
such a woman as Princess Napraxine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She will have the advantage of youth,
and also&mdash;which, perhaps, will count for something
with such a man as Othmar, though it
would not with most men&mdash;she will be his
wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps. He has been always eccentric,&rsquo;
rejoined the other.</p>

<p>Watching her with all the keen anxiety of
jealousy Geraldine had been unable to discover
that the intelligence of Othmar&rsquo;s marriage
caused her any more surprise or interest than
any other of the hundred and one items of news
which make up the daily pabulum of society.
But then he knew very well that she was of
such a character that though she might have
suffered intolerably she would have shown no
sign of it any more than she would have shown
any fear had a dozen naked sabres been at her
breast.</p>

<p>Left alone beside his sister for a moment,
he said to her, with doubting impatience: &lsquo;Does
she care, do you think?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What affair is it of yours if she does?&rsquo; re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>turned
Lady Brancepeth. &lsquo;Does she ever care
for anything? And why should she care here?
Othmar has been known to be violently in love
with her&mdash;as you are&mdash;but no one has ever
had the slightest reason to suppose that she
had any feeling in return for him. He does a
foolish thing in marrying one woman while he
loves another. Some men have faith in that cure.
Myself I should have none. But whatever
his reasons for this sudden choice of Mdlle. de
Valogne, I imagine that his marriage is a matter
of as perfect indifference to Nadine as your
own would be.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Geraldine grew red, and his mortification
kept him silent. But the insight of a man in
love told him that his keen-eyed sister was for
once in error.</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine herself had gone to her
own rooms to change her gown for dinner,
but she dismissed her maids for twenty minutes
and threw herself on a couch in her bedroom.
She was herself uncertain what she felt, and
angered that she should feel anything. She
was conscious of a sense of offence, irritation,
amazement, almost chagrin, which hurt her
pride and alarmed her dignity. If a month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
before she had been told that Othmar was
dead, she would have felt no more than a
momentary regret. But the strength of his
passion in the morning interviews with her had
touched some fibre, some nerve in her, which
had been dumb and numb before. Again and
again she had recalled the accents of his voice,
the sombre fire and pathetic entreaty of his
eyes; they had not moved her at the time to
anything more than the vague artistic pleasure
which she would have taken in any emotion
admirably rendered in art or on the stage, but
in remembrance they had haunted her and
thrilled through her with something more
nearly resembling response than had ever been
aroused in her.</p>

<p>The expectation of his return had been as
strong as certainty; the sense that she had gone
too far with him had heightened the interest
with which she had awaited her next meeting
with him. One of the greatest triumphs of
her fascination had been the power she had
exercised over him. She was the only living
person who could say to this man, who could
have purchased souls and bodies as he could
have purchased strings of unpierced pearls if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he had chosen: &lsquo;You desire something of
which you will never be master.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That she had had influence enough on such
a career as his to drive him out from the
world where all his interests, pursuits, and
friendships lay, had pleased her with more
keenness in her pleasure than similar victories
often gave her. She had seen his return to
Europe with amusement, even with derision;
she had seen at a glance that he had fled in
vain from her; she had been diverted, but she
had remained indifferent.</p>

<p>In those morning hours when he had
addressed her with an almost brutal candour,
he had taken a hold upon her admiration
which he had never gained before. His accents
had lingered on her ear; his regard had
burned itself into her remembrance; she had
begun to look forward to his next approach,
after her rejection, with something more than
the merely intellectual curiosity with which
before she had studied the results of her
influence upon him. The news of his intended
marriage came to her with a sense of
surprise and of affront which was more nearly
regret than any sentiment she had ever ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>perienced.
It seemed to her supremely ridiculous
that a man who adored <em>her</em> should seek
or hope to find any oblivion elsewhere; she
even understood that it was no such hope
which had actuated him, but rather his
wounded pride which had rebelled against herself
and been unwilling to allow the world to
consider him her slave. Of the more delicate
and more tender motives which had led him
towards Yseulte de Valogne she could know
nothing; but of those more selfish and embittered
ones she comprehended accurately all
the sources and all the extent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He does it to escape me,&rsquo; she thought as
she sat in solitude, while the last faint crimson
of the winter&rsquo;s sunset tinged the light clouds
before her windows; a smile came slowly on
her beautiful mouth,&mdash;a smile, proud, unkind,
a little bitter. There was resentment in her,
and there was also pain, two emotions hitherto
strangers to her heart; but beyond these, and
deeper than these, there was a caustic contempt
for the man&rsquo;s cowardice in seeking asylum in an
unreal love, in endeavouring to cheat himself
and another into belief in a feigned passion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thought him more brave!&rsquo; she said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
bitterly to herself. &lsquo;He is like a beaten
warrior who makes a rampart of a virgin&rsquo;s
body!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And yet, in that moment she was nearer
love for him than she had ever been before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
</div>


<p>Blanchette was dancing round her cousin in
the twilight of the January day, making her
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied de nez</i> triumphantly, but pausing every
now and then to look up in her face with her
habitual inquisitiveness, yet with a respect
quite new to her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tiens, tiens, tiens!</i>&rsquo; she was crying in her
little shrill voice, like the tiniest of silver
trumpets. &lsquo;To think you are going to be
married after all! You will be ever so much
richer than mamma, they say; you will be as
rich as all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Juiverie</i> put together, and you
will be as great a lady as all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grandes
dames</i>. You will have as many jewels as
Madame de Talleyrand; you will have as many
horses and houses as Madame de Sagan; you
will have two new gowns every day if you like.
Have you seen the Hôtel Othmar? I have
seen it; it is as big as the Louvre. What will
you ask him for first? If I were you, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
ask him for a rope of pearls, all as big as
pigeons&rsquo; eggs. What are the Othmar liveries?
I never saw them; the state liveries, I mean.
I like canary-colour best, and Louis Treize
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tricornes</i>. What will he settle on you? He
will give you what you wish; I heard mamma
say so. Make him give you S. Pharamond for
your very own. I am sure you will not get
half you might, you are such a silly little snipe;
you are as tall as a Venetian mast on a feast
day, but you are a simpleton. You cried when
mamma told you he would marry you. The idea!
You should have danced for joy. It would be
delicious to marry him if he were as old as the
hills and as ugly as Punch, but he is not old
and he is handsome: all that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par-dessus le
panier</i>, and thirty thousand francs a day, Julie
says; and Brown and Schemmitz wanted to kiss
your hand! What fun you would make of
them if you were me. You should skip and
shout all day;&mdash;I should. To be sure, he is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans
la finance</i>, but they are the only royalties nowadays;
I have heard mamma say so. Whatever
can he see in you? You are pretty and tall,
but you don&rsquo;t know it; you stand and stare
like an owl with your big eyes. What can he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
want with you? He will give you everything,
he must be a simpleton, too! he might marry
somebody quite great; none of them can
imagine what he wants you for&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Blanchette!&rsquo; said Yseulte de Valogne,
with a look of pain, as she tried to silence her
little tormentor, whose words she only vaguely
heard as she stood lost in the golden mists of
an incomparable dream.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vrai!</i>&rsquo; said the cruel little child. &lsquo;Nobody
can think what he can see in you. It is
Madame Napraxine whom he loves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte coloured with sudden anger, and a
look of severity and sternness came on her
youthful face, while its happy wistful eyes lost
their light and grew cold:</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must not say these things, Blanchette,&rsquo;
she said sternly; &lsquo;you may laugh at me as
you like, but you must respect M. Othmar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The red deepened in her cheeks as she
spoke, and realised that she had the right to
defend his name thus. She was thinking in
herself as she did so: &lsquo;If it were true, if I
thought it were true, I would bury myself in
the convent for ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The quick little mind of Blanchette divined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the direction of her thoughts, and dearly as the
child loved to do mischief and to torment, she
loved her own pleasure and gain better. She
had no wish for this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau mariage</i> to be broken
off, as she foresaw from it endless diversion,
gifts, and bonbons for herself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Othmar will give us each at least a medallion
with diamonds on the back,&rsquo; she reflected;
and she was conscious, too, that if the marriage
fell through by any doing of hers, her mother
would be unsparing in her punishment, of
which not the least portion would be banishment
to Bois de Roy; for Blanchette adored
her spring-time in Paris, her summer months
at Deauville and Homburg and Biarritz, her
wagers on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petits chevaux</i>, her exploits in the
water, and the many whispers of scandals and
naughty witticisms which she caught, when
apparently engrossed with her toy balloon or
her ball, behind the chairs of her mother and
other great ladies on the sand by the sea or
under the trees of the fashionable inland
baths.</p>

<p>With a rapid remembrance of all that she
herself would lose if there were no grand wedding
at which she would assist at the Madeleine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
or S. Philippe du Roule, she threw her arms
about her cousin with her most coaxing
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">câlinerie</i>: &lsquo;It was only my fun,&rsquo; she whispered;
&lsquo; pray don&rsquo;t tell any one, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chérie</i>. It was years
and years ago that they laughed about Madame
Napraxine; of course, it is you he loves now.
Why should he marry you if he did not? He
could marry anywhere, anybody,&mdash;mamma says
so. And you <em>are</em> handsome, if you would only
think it! Mamma says when you shall have
been married a week, and have all your jewels
you will be superb.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her cousin&rsquo;s face flushed more warmly till
it was the hue of those Charles Raybaud roses
which she had used to pack for Nicole. Her
heart beat in that tumult of emotion, of joy, and
of vague, most sweet, fear, in which she had
lived for the last twenty-four hours. She
thought: &lsquo;Why, if he did not care for me,
why, indeed, should he seek me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>It seemed marvellous to her that it should
be so, but she could not doubt it.</p>

<p>She had only seen him for ten minutes that
morning, in the presence of the Duchesse de
Vannes, but though her confusion had been too
great to let her eyes meet his, the few soft grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
words he had spoken, and the touch of his lips
on her hand, had left with her an ineffable
sense of protection and affection received. If
it were not for love, why should he have paused
on his way to thrust back the gates of the
convent and take her to himself?</p>

<p>As for herself, the timid, pure, half-unconscious
feeling which he had awakened in her
was growing in strength with every hour now
that it had recognised its own existence and
been permitted its expansion without shame.
It remained as shy and fearful as a freshly
captured wood-dove, but it had in it all the
elements of an intense and devoted passion.</p>

<p>She did not hear the child&rsquo;s chatter, which
rippled on like a little brook, asking her a
thousand questions of what she would do, of
what she would wear, of what she would give
away. Blanchette was herself half sympathetic,
half envious; disposed to resent her cousin&rsquo;s
sudden and splendid change of destiny, yet
inclined to rejoice in it, as it would secure to
herself a spectacle, a new costume, and a costly
gift. She kept looking at the girl critically,
with her head on one side, and affecting to
help her only hindered her, as she dressed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the first ceremonious dinner at which she had
ever assisted.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To think you can dress yourself; how
queer!&rsquo; cried the little censor. &lsquo;I cannot put
on a stocking, nor Toinon either. I never
mean to do it. Mamma could not to save her
life. How many women will you have? Two?
three? Never let your maids carry your jewel-box;
have it always put in the train by your
major-domo, between two footmen. Mamma
says all the robberies are done by the maids.
What are you going to put on? You have
only white frocks. Don&rsquo;t you long to wear
satin and velvet? Oh, you are so stupid; you
ought to marry a shepherd, and wear lambs&rsquo;-wool
that you spun yourself. You must not
be so simple. A Countess Othmar ought to
be very magnificent. The finance is nothing
if it do not look gorgeous. Oh, what are you
doing? You must not put a black sash on;
you are a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i>. Have you got nothing but
black? Wait a minute; I will run and get
one of mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have always worn something black or
grey since my grandmother died,&rsquo; said Yseulte,
a little sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>But Blanchette made a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pirouette</i>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Henri IV. est sur le Pont-Neuf!&rsquo; she cried.
&lsquo;Oh, you silly! You were Cendrillon yesterday;
now you are the prince&rsquo;s betrothed. Yesterday
you were a little brown grub; now you
are a butterfly. I will go and get my sash.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The child flew out of the room and left
Yseulte standing before the mirror, looking
shyly at her own reflection as though she saw
a stranger. She felt, indeed, a stranger to
herself; so long she had been resigned to
the religious life, so long she had been accustomed
to regard obscurity, neglect, sadness,
loneliness, as her natural lot; so long she had
been trained to submission, lectured to the
shade and the silence of resignation, that to be
thus suddenly called out into the light, and lifted
on to a pedestal, dazzled and almost paralysed
her.</p>

<p>It seemed to her as though it could never
be herself, Yseulte de Valogne, to whom her
cousin had said, with an admiration that was
almost reverence: &lsquo;You will be the most
enviable woman in Europe. Do you understand
all you have done for yourself?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She did not understand it; she only un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>derstood
that he had rescued her from the
conventual life, and that he loved her&mdash;surely
he loved her, or he would not wish?&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Blanchette flew back into the room, accompanied
by the maid Françoise.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yseulte! Yseulte!&rsquo; she shrieked, waving
a blue sash in one hand and with the other
clasping to her a square parcel tied with silver
cord. &lsquo;Here is something he sends you:
Françoise was bringing it. Open it quick,
quick. Oh, what a happy creature you are,
and you only stand and stare like the statues in
the Luxembourg! Open it quick! It is sure
to be something worth thousands and thousands
of francs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hush, Blanchette!&rsquo; said the girl, with a
look of pain, as she took the packet and undid
its covering. Within was the ivory casket;
and within the casket was a necklace of great
pearls.</p>

<p>A little note lay on them, which said
merely:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>No one can dispossess you of the casket
now. Receive what is within as a symbol of
your own innocence and of my reverence for it.&mdash;Yours,
with devotion</em>, <span class="smcap">Othmar</span>.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other side of the paper was written
more hastily:&mdash;&lsquo;<em>Pardon me that I must leave
immediately after dinner for Paris and shall
not see you for a few days. I have explained
to the Duchesse.</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte grew very pale. If the eyes of her
little tormentor and of the woman Françoise
had not been on her, she would have kissed his
note and fallen on her knees and wept. As it
was, she stood still in silence, reading the lines
again and again, with sweet, warm tears in her
eyes. It was Blanchette who took out the
pearls and held them up in the lamplight, and
appraised their value with the keenness of a
jeweller and screamed in rapture over their
size and colour.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They <em>are</em> the pigeon&rsquo;s eggs!&rsquo; she cried,
&lsquo; and four ropes of them; they must be worth
an empire. They are as fine as mamma&rsquo;s,
and she has only three rows. I will marry into
the finance myself. Oh, what a happy creature
you are! Brown says it all came out of your
going to gather flowers in his garden. Is that
true? How clever it was of you! Who would
ever have believed you were so clever, with
your silent ways and your countryfied scruples.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Let me see his note? You will not? What
nonsense! You must put the pearls on. Let
me fasten them. Four ropes! They are fit
for a Court ball. What a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corbeille</i> he will send
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>As she chattered she clasped it round the
throat of her cousin, who grew red, then white,
as the pearls touched her skin. They made
her realise the immense change which one short
day had made in her lot. They made her
realise that Othmar henceforth was her lover.</p>

<p>While Blanchette chirped and skipped
around her, directing her toilette with the accurate
instinct in decoration of a little Parisienne,
the eyes of the girl were suffused with unshed
tears of gratitude and tremulous joy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

    <p>&lsquo;What can I render thee, O princely giver?&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>she was saying in her heart, although she had
never read the Portuguese sonnets; while her
little cousin babbled on of jewels and ball-dresses,
and horses and establishments, and
dowries and settlements, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime dotal</i>,
and all the many matters which meant marriage
to the precocious comprehension of Blanchette.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will have your box at all the theatres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
will you not? You have never been to a
theatre, but I have. Mind that you go the
evening after your marriage. When will your
marriage be? I heard mamma say that he
wished it to be very soon: but then there is all
your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lingerie</i>, and all your gowns to be made.
I suppose mamma will give you your trousseau;
she must. Oh, how happy you ought to
be, and you look just as grave as an owl! Nobody
would guess you were going to be the
Countess Othmar. Do you know that he could
be made a prince if he liked? You have
never learned to ride, Yseulte. What a pity!
It is so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</i> to ride early in the Bois. Well,
you will have a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coupé</i> for the early morning,
and then you will have a Daumont for the
afternoon, of course. There is nothing so
pretty as postillions in velvet jackets and
caps&mdash;if you only knew what colour his
liveries are? Won&rsquo;t you have out-riders? I do
not know, though, whether you can; I think
it is only ambassadresses and princesses of
the blood who may have out-riders&mdash;&mdash;You
might have a special train every day,&rsquo;
continued Blanchette, exciting herself with her
own visions. &lsquo;There is nothing such fun as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
special train; we had one when grandmère was
dying at Bois le Roy all in a moment and
wanted to see us; it is so diverting to go on,
on, on, through all the stations, past all the
other trains, never stopping&mdash;pr-r-r-rut!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, hush, Blanchette! What do I care
about those things?&rsquo; murmured Yseulte, as she
put his note into the casket, locked it, and
slipped the little silver key in her bosom, blushing
very much as she did so.</p>

<p>It seemed so very wonderful to her that
such lines should have been written to her.
She wanted to be all alone to muse upon the
marvel of it. She remembered a little nook
in the convent garden where a bench was fixed
against the high stone wall, under the branches
of an old medlar tree; a place that she had
gone to with her sorrows, her fancies, her
visions, her tears, very often; she would have
liked to have gone now to some such quiet
and solitary nook, to realise in peace this
miracle which had been wrought for her.
But that was impossible; they had ordered her
to dine with them at eight&mdash;her first great
dinner. She must submit to be gazed at, commented
on, complimented, felicitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The sensitive, delicate nature of the child
shrank from the publicity of her triumph; but
she understood that it was her duty, that henceforth
these things would be a prominent portion
of her duties; the wife of Othmar could not
live shut away from the world.</p>

<p>Blanchette tossed her golden head with immeasurable
contempt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is all &ldquo;those things&rdquo; that make a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand
mariage</i>. If you think you do not care now,
you will care in a year&rsquo;s time. Mamma said so.
Mamma said you will be just like anybody else
when you shall have been in the world six
months.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte shook her head with a smile, but
she sighed a little also; it pained her that the
world, and all it gave, was so intermingled with
this beautiful, incredible, dream-like joy which
had come to her like some vision brought by
angels. In the singleness and sincerity of her
young heart she thought: &lsquo;Ah! if only he
were poor!&mdash;how I wish he were poor!&mdash;then
they would know and he!&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>But he was not poor, and he had sent her
pearls worthy of an empress, and Blanchette
was dancing before her in envy, longing to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
sixteen years old too and betrothed to an archi-millionaire.</p>

<p>She cast one last timid glance at herself
and at the great pearls lying beneath the
slender ivory column of her throat, then she
drew on her long gloves, and went, with a
quickly-beating heart, down the staircase, Blanchette
shouting after her Judic&rsquo;s song,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">On ne peut pas savoir ce que c&rsquo;est,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Ce que c&rsquo;est,</div>
    <div class="verse">Si on n&rsquo;a pas passé par là!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>which the child had caught up from the echoes
of the boulevards, and sang with as much by-play
and meaning as Judic herself could have
put into it.</p>

<p>There were some twenty people assembled
in the oval drawing-room when Yseulte entered
it. It was not of them she was afraid: it was
of seeing Othmar before them. There was a
murmur of admiration as she appeared in her
childish white dress, with the superb necklace
on, which a queen might have worn at a
Court ball. Her shyness did not impair her
grace; the stateliness and pride which were in
her blood gave her composure even in her
timidity; her eyes were dark and soft with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
conflicting feelings, her colour came and went.
She never spoke audibly once in answer to all
the compliment and felicitation she received,
but she looked so lovely and so young that no
one quarrelled with her silence. When Othmar
gave her his arm she trembled from head to
foot, but no one noticed it save Othmar himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not be afraid of me, my child,&rsquo; he
murmured, and for the first time she took
courage and looked at him with a rapid glance
that was like a beam of sunlight. The look
said to him, &lsquo;I am not afraid, I am grateful; I
love you, only I dare not say so, and I hardly
understand what has happened.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The dinner seemed both to her and to
him interminable; she was quite silent through
it, and ate nothing. She was conscious of
a sullen gaze which her cousin, de Vannes,
fastened on her, and which made her feel
that, by him, she was unforgiven. She was
confused by the florid speech made to her by
the Baron Friederich, who was so enchanted by
her that he put no measure to his audible
admiration. Othmar, seated beside her, said
very little. The party was gay, and the conversation
animated. The silence of each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
them passed unnoticed. The Duchesse, who
alone remarked it, said to Raymond de Prangins:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is their way of being in love; it is the
old way, which they have copied out of Lamartine
and Bernardin de St. Pierre. It is infinitely
droll that Othmar should play the sentimental
lover, but he does. I want Nadine Napraxine
to see him like that. I asked her to dinner,
but they had a dinner party at home. She
sent me a little line just now, promising, if her
people were gone, to come for an hour in the
evening. The child looks well, does she not?
What jewels he has given her! They are
bigger than mine. It is the least he can do;
the Finance is bound to buy big jewels. Who
would ever have supposed he would have seen
anything in that baby, that convent mouse? To
be sure, she is handsome. Such a marriage
for that little mouse to make! a mere baby
like that, a child proud of being the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">médaillon</i>
of her convent yesterday! After all, nothing
takes some men like that air of innocence,
which bores them to death as soon as they have
put an end to it. It is like dew; it is like
drinking milk in the meadow in the morning;
we don&rsquo;t care for the milk, but the doctors say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
it is good for us, and so&mdash;&mdash;I wonder what
she is thinking about. About her gowns, I
dare say, or about her jewels. She is just like
a vignette out of &ldquo;Paul et Virginie.&rdquo; She
need not pretend to be in love with him; no
one will believe in it; he will not believe in
it himself; he is too rich. What can he have
seen in her more than in five thousand other
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillettes</i> he might have married? To be sure
she is handsome. She will be handsomer&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She put up her eyeglass and looked down
the table at her young cousin with amusement
and envy, mingled as they mingled in little
Blanchette. The amusement was at the girl&rsquo;s
evident embarrassment, the envy was of her
youth, of her complexion, of her form, of all
which told her own unerring instincts that
Yseulte in a few years, even in a few months,
would be one of the most beautiful women of
her world.</p>

<p>And she said angrily to de Prangins, &lsquo;Some
men like children; it is as boys like green
apples.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;At least the green apples are not painted,&rsquo;
thought the young man as he murmured aloud
a vague compliment. Raymond de Prangins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
like most men of his age, had never looked
twice at a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>; he had been three weeks in
the same house with this child and had never
addressed a word to her or noticed whether
her eyes were black or brown; but now that
she had become the betrothed wife of Othmar,
the charm of the forbidden fruit had come to
her; she had suddenly become an object of
interest in his sight; he was never tired of
finding out her beauties, he was absorbed in
studying the shape of her throat, the colour of
her hair, the whiteness of her shoulders, which
came so timidly and with a little shiver, like
shorn lambs, out of the first low bodice that
she had ever worn. To know that she was
about to belong to another man, gave her all at
once importance, enchantment, and desirability
in his sight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p>Immediately that the dinner was over Othmar
made his excuses and left Millo to take the
night express to Paris. When once she knew
that he was absent, she lost all fear.</p>

<p>Her innocent love was at that stage when
the presence of a lover is full of trouble and
alarm, and the happiest hours are those in
which his absence permits its dreams to wander
about her memory undisturbed. When he was
there he was still, to her, a stranger whose gaze
embarrassed her, whose touch confused her,
whose association with herself was unfamiliar
and unreal; but, away from him, there was
nothing to check or dismay those spiritual and
poetic fancies which had lodged their ideal in
him. No one of those around her would ever
have imagined that she had these fancies, or
would have understood them in the slightest
degree; they only thought that she was very
naturally enraptured to be chosen by a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
rich man, and did not doubt that in her mind
she was musing, as Blanchette had suggested,
on the colour of her liveries, the number of
her horses, the places of her residence, and the
prospect of her jewels.</p>

<p>Baron Fritz, who made her blush with the
fervour of his compliments, and was so delighted
with her that he could not cease from gazing at
her as though she were a water-colour of Copley
Fielding&rsquo;s, was alone sufficiently sympathetic,
despite all his seventy years of cynicism, to
perceive that the things of this world had little
place in her thoughts, and he thought to himself
as he looked at her:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will Otho be wise enough to appreciate
all that? He will have the carnation in its
bud, the peach in its flower; he will make just
what he pleases of them; the worse will be if
he should leave them altogether alone: then
the carnation will unfold, the peach will ripen
and come out into fruit unnoticed, and if he
be an ingrate, they will both come to their
perfection for someone else&mdash;which will be a
pity. The child is in love with him&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parbleu!</i>&mdash;he
does not deserve it; he only cares for his
Russian woman, his hothouse narcissus; he only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
wants to cure himself of Nadine Napraxine;
as if one blush of this child&rsquo;s cheek were not
worth a century of Madame Napraxine&rsquo;s languor!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And he felt a passing regret that he was
not forty years younger and in the place of
his nephew.</p>

<p>After dinner he seated himself beside Yseulte,
and talked to her of Othmar, of his boyhood,
of his talents, of his opportunities, and of his
destinies, with so much tact and so much skill
that she was moved to an affectionate gratitude
towards the speaker and to a sense of infinite
awe before all the ambitions and responsibilities
with which he filled her future.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She is a baby, but she is not a fool,&rsquo;
thought the wise old man. &lsquo;When the love
fever has passed, we shall make of her just what
we want, provided only that she has influence
over Otho. But will she have any? In marriage
there is always one who rules the other:
&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un qui se baisse, et l&rsquo;autre qui tend la joue</i>&rdquo;:
and it is always the one who <em>cares</em> who goes
under.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Even as he had eaten his truffles and drunk
the fine wines grown on the de Vannes&rsquo; estates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in Gironde, he had been more troubled by an
impersonal anxiety than he had ever allowed
himself to be in the whole course of his existence.
The child had sat opposite to him,
looking so youthful beside the faces, more or
less <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquillées</i>, of the women around her,
with her soft surprised eyes, happy as those of
a child that wakes from sleep, and her colour
coming and going, delicate and warm: &lsquo;And
he will not stay here to see, just because the
desire for another woman is in him like a fly
in the ear of a horse!&rsquo; had thought the Baron
impatiently. He guessed very accurately that
the departure of Othmar was due to a restless
unwillingness to face the fate which he had
voluntarily made for himself.</p>

<p>He himself had had no heed of Othmar&rsquo;s
marriage except as a means of legally continuing
his race; his only notion of a woman
was Napoleon&rsquo;s, that she should bear many
children; but as he looked at Yseulte de
Valogne, something kinder and more pitiful
stirred in his selfish old heart; she seemed to
him too good to be sacrificed so; he understood
that there would be other things than
money and children which this sensitive plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
would want; and worldly, unemotional, and unprincipled
as he was, Baron Fritz was the only
person present who divined something of the
dreams which she was dreaming and felt a compassionate
regret for them, as for flowers which
opened at dawn to die perforce at noonday.</p>

<p>About eleven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when
Yseulte was beginning to feel her eyelids grow
heavy, and was thinking wistfully of her little
white bed amidst the murmur of conversation
unintelligible to her and the stare of inquisitive
eyes, she heard with a little thrill of an emotion
quite new to her the voice of the groom of the
chambers, which announced Madame la Princesse
Napraxine.</p>

<p>Jealousy she was too young, too simple,
and too innocent to know; but a strange
eagerness and an unanalysed pain moved her
as she saw the woman whom they said that
Othmar loved.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that really Madame Napraxine?&rsquo; she
said in a low voice to the Baron, who was
beside her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who has told you of Madame Napraxine?&rsquo;
he thought, as he answered her: &lsquo;Yes! that is
the name of the lady coming in now; she is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
famous European beauty, though to my taste
she is too slender and too pale.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl did not reply; her eyes followed
the trail of Princess Nadine&rsquo;s pale primrose-coloured
skirts laden with lace, and fastened
here and there with large lilies and lilac. Before
that inimitable grace, that exquisite languor
and ease, that indescribable air of indifference
and of empire and of disdain which made the
peculiar power of Nadine Napraxine, the poor
child felt her own insignificance, her own childishness,
her own powerlessness; she fancied she
must look rustic, awkward, stupid: she grew
very pale, and her throat swelled with pain
under her lover&rsquo;s pearls.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is too early for you to have that adder
in your breast,&rsquo; thought Friederich Othmar, as
he watched her. &lsquo;What a coward he was to
go away, instead of standing his ground beside
you! After all, why is everyone so afraid of
this Russian woman?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Aloud, he only said: &lsquo;The Princess is
coming to you; courage, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon enfant</i>. A woman
of the world is certainly an alarming animal,
but you will have to meet many such, and
you will be one yourself before very long.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fillette</i>, come and be presented to Mme.
Napraxine; she wishes it,&rsquo; said her cousin at
that moment in her ear. The girl shrank back
a little, and the colour came into her face; she
rose, nevertheless, obediently.</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine came half-way to meet
her, with an indulgent little smile, of which the
compassion and disdain penetrated the inmost
soul of Yseulte with a cruel sense of inferiority.
Yet had she not been so humble and so embarrassed
she might have seen a look of surprise
in the eyes of her rival. Nadine saw at a
glance that in this child there was no &lsquo;Sainte
Mousseline&rsquo; to be easily derided and contemned.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How beautiful a woman she will be in a
year or two!&rsquo; she thought, with that candour
which was never lacking in her in her judgments
of her greatest foes. &lsquo;He is going to
possess all that, and he only sighs in his soul
for me!&mdash;what fools men are!&rsquo;</p>

<p>While she so thought, she was still smiling
as she came to meet Yseulte with that slow,
soft, indescribable grace of which she had the
secret.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am an old friend of Count Othmar&rsquo;s;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
you must let me be yours in the future,&rsquo; she
said with gracious kindliness. &lsquo;Shall I offend
you if I venture to say that I am sure he is a
very happy and fortunate person? I dare say
I shall please you better if I say that he deserves
to be so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl could not have found words to
answer to save her life. Instinctively she made
her grand eighteenth-century curtsy in acknowledgment.
She was very pale; her heart
seemed to sink within her as she realised all
the charm of this her rival.</p>

<p>Mme. de Vannes murmured a few amiable
words, and left them opposite to one another;
the girl trembled despite herself, as those indolent
lustrous eyes scanned her with merciless
investigation and smiled at her embarrassment.</p>

<p>It was her first experience of that obligation,
so constant in the world, to meet what is
dreaded and disliked with suavity and compliment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am a great friend of your cousin, too,&rsquo;
continued Nadine Napraxine, with all the
amiable condescension of a woman of the world
to a child. &lsquo;We shall be sure to meet con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>stantly
in the years to come, which will leave
you so young and make us so old! Where
have you lived? In an old Breton convent?
I wish I had lived in a Breton convent too!
Come and sit by me and talk to me a little.
Do you know that I am here to-night on
purpose to see you. I had a tiresome dinner,
all of Russian people, or I should have come
here earlier.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She drew the girl down beside her on a sofa
with that pretty imperiousness of which women
as well as men often felt the charm and the
command. She was most kindly, most gentle,
most flattering, yet Yseulte suffered under all
her gracious compliments as under the most
poignant irony. She answered in monosyllables
and at random; she was ill at ease and confused,
she looked down with the fascination of
a bird gazing at a snake on the hand which
held hers, such a slender hand in its tan-coloured
glove and with its circles of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-bonheurs</i>
above the wrist, and its heavy bracelets
crowding one another almost to the elbow.</p>

<p>She would not have spoken more than Yes
or No to save her life, and she said even these
in the wrong places; but Nadine Napraxine did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
not make the mistake of thinking her stupid, as
less intelligent women would have done.</p>

<p>She studied her curiously whilst she continued
to speak those amiable and careless
nothings which are the armoury of social life;
toy weapons of which the young know neither
the use nor the infinite value. She had all
the kindly condescension, the good-humoured,
amused indulgence, of a grown woman of the
world for a schoolgirl; by dates she was only
seven years older than Yseulte de Valogne, but
in experience and knowledge she was fifty years
her senior.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle est vraiment très bien</i>,&rsquo; she said, as
she turned away from the girl and took the
arm of Friederich Othmar. &lsquo;At present she is
like a statue in the clay, like a sketch, like
a magnolia flower folded up; but Othmar will
change all that. You must be so glad; his
marriage must have been such an anxiety to
you. Suppose he had married a Mongol!
What would you have done?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was not precisely of the Mongol that
I was most afraid, Madame,&rsquo; replied the Baron.
&lsquo; Do you think too that a marriage is a termination
to anyone&rsquo;s anxieties? Surely, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
dangerous romance begins afterwards in life as
in novels.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It would be very dull reading in either if
it did not,&rsquo; said Madame Napraxine. &lsquo;But we
will hope that Mademoiselle and your nephew
will read theirs together, and eschew the
dangers; that is possible sometimes; and she
will have one great advantage for the next five
years; she will be handsomer every year.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It will be a great advantage if he find her
so, but perhaps only others will find her so;
marriage does not lend rose-coloured spectacles
to its disciples,&rsquo; thought the Baron, as he
answered aloud, &lsquo;There can be no one&rsquo;s opinion
that he could value as much as he is sure to do
that of Madame Napraxine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I imagine my opinion matters nothing at
all to him,&rsquo; she answered, with her enigmatical
smile. &lsquo;But when I see him I shall certainly
be able to congratulate him with much more
truth than one can usually put into those
conventionalities. Mademoiselle de Valogne is
very beautiful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Baron sadly recalled the saying of that
wise man who was of opinion that it makes
little difference after three months whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
your wife be a Venus or a Hottentot; but he
did not utter this blasphemy to a lovely woman.</p>

<p>The girl remained on her sofa gazing wistfully
after this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élégante</i> who had all the knowledge
which she lacked, and who impressed her
so sadly with an indefinite dull sense of inferiority
and of helplessness. She put her hand
up to her throat and felt for his pearls; they
seemed like friends; they seemed to assure her
of his affection and of the future. People
thought she was proud of them because they
were so large, so perfect in colour and shape,
so royal in their value; she would have been as
pleased with them if they had been strings of
berries out of the woods, and he had sent them
with the same message and meaning.</p>

<p>She watched Nadine Napraxine with fascinated
eyes; wondering where was the secret
of that supreme seduction which even she, in
her convent-bred simplicity, could feel was in
her. In the few words which had been addressed
to her she was dimly conscious that
the other disdained her as a child, and derided
Othmar as a fool.</p>

<p>Madame de Vannes roused her from her
preoccupation with a tap of her fan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;How grave you look, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>,&rsquo; she said with
some impatience. &lsquo;You must never look like
that now you are in the world. Everyone
detests grave people. If you cannot always
smile, stay in your convent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; murmured Yseulte,
waking from her meditation with a little shock.
&lsquo;I did not know&mdash;I was thinking&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is just what you must not do when
you are in society. What were you thinking
of? You looked very sombre.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl coloured and hesitated, then she
said very low:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The other day&mdash;the day of the casket&mdash;you
said he loved her&mdash;was it true?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She glanced across the room at Nadine
Napraxine as she spoke.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did I say so?&rsquo; answered the Duchesse,
with annoyance at herself. &lsquo;Then I talked
great nonsense. But how was I to know then
that he was thinking of you? Listen to me,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>,&rsquo; she continued, with more real kindness
in her tone than the girl had ever heard there.
&lsquo; You will hear all kinds of scandals, insinuations,
stories of all sorts in the world that you
will live in; never listen to them, or you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
be perpetually irritated and unhappy. People
say all sorts of untruths out of sheer idleness;
they must talk. M. Othmar must certainly
have some very especial esteem for you, or
why should he choose you out of all womankind
for his wife? That is all you have to
think of; do not perplex yourself as to whom
he may, or may not, have loved beforehand.
All your care must be that he shall love no one
else afterwards. You are tired, I think; go to
bed, if you like: you can slip away unnoticed.
You are only a child yet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte went at once, thankful for the
permission, yet looking wistfully still at the
delicate head of Nadine Napraxine, as it rose
up from a collar of emeralds. Madame de
Vannes passed to the music room, where a
little operetta was being given, with a vague
compassion stirring in her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sure the old Marquise could not have
given her more moral advice than I,&rsquo; she
thought, &lsquo;but I am afraid the silly child will
have trouble, she is so old-fashioned. Why
cannot she marry the man, and enjoy all he
will give her, without perplexing herself as to
what fancies he may have had for other people?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
What does it matter? She will have to get
used to that sort of thing. If it be not Nadine
who makes her jealous, it will be someone else;
but one could not tell her that. How right I
was not to send Blanchette and Toinon to a
convent! The holy women make them so
romantic, so emotional, so <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pleurnicheuses</i>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>At the same moment Nadine Napraxine
said, when she had left her and was speaking
to Melville of her:</p>

<p>&lsquo;She is very interesting. She will have
plenty of character; he thinks that he is marrying
a child; he forgets that she will grow up, and
that very rapidly. Marriage is a hothouse for
women who are young. I was married at her
age; in three months&rsquo; time I felt as old&mdash;as
old&mdash;as old as I do now. Nobody can feel
older! You are sixty-five, you say, and you are
so young. That is because you are not married
and can believe in Paradise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You mean that I hope for compensation?&rsquo;
said Melville, with his pleasant laugh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Or that you keep your illusions. There
is so much in that. People who do are always
young. I do not think I ever had any to
lose!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;It is great emotions which make happy illusions,
and I believe you have never permitted
those to approach you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have viewed them from afar off, as
Lucretius says one ought to see a storm.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not doubt you have seen them very
often, Princess,&rsquo; said Melville, with significance.
&lsquo;But as you have not shared them, they have
passed by you like great waves which leave no
mark upon the smoothness of the sand on which
they break.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; she said, while her mind reverted
to the scene of which her boudoir had been the
theatre three days before; then she added a
little abruptly: &lsquo;You know Mlle. de Valogne
well&mdash;you are interested in her? What do
you think of her marriage?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have known her from the time she was
four years old,&rsquo; replied Melville. &lsquo;I have seen
her at intervals at the convent of Faïel. I am
convinced she has no common character; she is
very unlike the young girls one sees in the
world, who have had their course of Deauville,
Aix, and Biarritz. She is of the antique French
patrician type; perhaps the highest human type
that the world has ever seen, and the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
capable of self-restraint, of heroism, of true distinction,
and of loyalty. I fancy Elizabeth de
France must have been just such a girl as is
Yseulte de Valogne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What eulogy!&rsquo; returned his companion,
with a little incredulous accent. &lsquo;I have
always wondered that your Church did not
canonize the Princess Elizabeth. But you
do not tell me what you think of the marriage.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Melville smiled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I might venture to prophecy if the success
of a marriage depended on two persons, but
it depends on so many others.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very mysterious; I do not see
what others have to do with it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; thought Melville, &lsquo;how often
you have stretched out your delicate fingers
and pushed down the most finely-wrought web
of human happiness&mdash;just for pastime!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Aloud he said: &lsquo;If she and he were about
to live their lives on a desert island, I am convinced
they would be entirely suited to each
other. But as they will live in the world, and
perforce in what they call the great world, who
shall presume to say what their marriage will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
become? It may pass into that indifferent and
amiable friendship which is the most usual
issue of such marriages, or it may grow into
that direct antagonism which is perhaps its still
commoner result; on the other hand, it may
become that perfect flower of human sympathy
which, like the aloe, blossoms once in a century;
but, if that miracle happen, such flowers
are not immortal; an unkind grasp will suffice
to break them off at the root. On the whole,
I am not especially hopeful; she is too young,
and he&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And he?&rsquo; said Nadine Napraxine, with a
gleam of curiosity in her glance.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not his confessor; I doubt if he ever
confess&mdash;to his own sex,&rsquo; replied Melville;
&lsquo;but if I had been, I should have said to him:
&ldquo;My son, one does not cure strong fevers with
meadow-daisies; wait till your soul is cleansed
before you offer it to a child whom you take
from God.&rdquo; That is what I should have said
in the confessional; but I only know Othmar
on the neutral ground of society. I cannot
presume to say it there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are too serious, Monsignore,&rsquo; said
Nadine, with her enigmatical smile. &lsquo;Marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
is not such a very serious thing, I assure you.
Ask Platon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Prince Napraxine is exceptionally happy,&rsquo;
said Melville, so gravely that she laughed gaily
in his face.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Yseulte dismissed the maid,
undressed herself slowly, kissed the pearls
when she had unclasped them; and, kneeling
down under her crucifix, said many prayers for
Othmar.</p>

<p>She was soon asleep, like a tired child, and
she had his note under her pillow; nevertheless,
she dreamed of Nadine Napraxine, and
her sleep was not the pure unbroken rest that
she had always had before. Once she awoke
in a great terror, her heart beating, her limbs
trembling.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If he did not love me!&rsquo; she cried aloud;
then the light of the lamp fell on the open
casket, on the necklace of pearls. They seemed
to say to her, &lsquo;What should he want with you,
unless he loved you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She fell asleep again, and with a smile on
her face.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
</div>


<p>The fortnight passed away rapidly and dizzily
for her. They took her at once to Paris, and
gave her no time for thought. She lived in a
perpetual movement, which dazzled her as a
blaze of fireworks would dazzle a forest doe.
All the preparations of a great marriage were
perpetually around her, and she began to
realise that the world thought her lot most
enviable and rare. Often her head ached and
her ears were tired with the perpetual stream
of compliment and felicitation, the continual
demands made on her time, on her patience, on
her gratitude. What would have been ecstasy
to Blanchette was to her very nearly pain.
There were moments when she almost longed
for the great, still, walled gardens of the Dames
de Ste. Anne, for her little whitewashed room,
her rush chair in the chapel, her poor grey
frock.</p>

<p>Then she thought of Othmar, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
colour came into her face and she was happy,
though always unquiet and a little alarmed, as
a dove is when its owner&rsquo;s hand is stretched
out to it.</p>

<p>To Yseulte he was a hero, a saint, an ideal.
He had come so suddenly into her life, he had
transformed it so completely, that he had something
of a magical fascination and glory for her.
She knew nothing of the House of Othmar, or
of their position in finance; if she had understood
it, she would have disliked it with the
instinctive pride of a daughter of &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les preux</i>;&lsquo;
she had a vague, confused idea of him as the
possessor of great power and wealth, but that
taint of commerce, which in Othmar&rsquo;s eyes
soiled every napoleon he touched, had not
dimmed his majesty for her.</p>

<p>She was never allowed to see him alone;
her cousin insisted on the strictest observance of
&rsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les convenances</i>,&rsquo; and though a Romeo would
have found means to circumvent these rules, her
lover did not. He was glad of the stiff laws
of etiquette which forbade him unwitnessed
interviews. He felt that if she asked him
straightway, with her clear eyes on his, what
love he had for her, a lie would not come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
easily to his lips. He was lavish of all offerings
to her, as though to atone materially for the
feeling that was wanting in him. The Duchesse
was herself astonished at the magnificence and
frequency of his gifts. Unasked, he settled
S. Pharamond and an estate in Seine et Oise
upon her in absolute possession, while a commensurate
income was secured to her to render
her wholly independent in the future of any
whim or will of his own.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is really very generous,&rsquo; said the
Duchesse to herself. &lsquo;But what perplexes me
is, he is not in love; not the very least in love!
If he were, one would understand it all. But
he is not in the very slightest degree <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amouraché</i>;
not half as much as Alain is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But she was heedful that no suggestion of
this fact, which her observation made clear to
her, should escape her before Yseulte or anyone
else. If he were not in love, yet still wished to
marry, it was his own affair; and she was not
his keeper.</p>

<p>To Yseulte, it was absolute shame to find
that she was regarded by all who approached
her as having done something clever, won
something enviable in the lottery of life. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
vague distress weighed on her before the
motives which she felt were attributed to her.</p>

<p>When her cousin said to her, &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fillette</i>, you
were really very audacious when you went
to gather those flowers at S. Pharamond. But
audacity succeeds&mdash;Voltaire and Napoléon were
right,&rsquo; she could have wept with humiliation
and indignation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he thinks as badly of me, too!&rsquo;
she thought, in that perplexity which had never
ceased, since his gift of the ivory casket, to torment
her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is storm in the air,&rsquo; said the Duc once
to his wife; &lsquo;Othmar will be like one of those
magicians who used to raise a force that they
could neither guide nor quell. He is making a
child worship him, and forgetting that he will
make her a woman, and that then she will
not be satisfied with being hung about with
trinkets, and set ankle-deep in gold like an
Indian goddess. I am quite sure that this
marriage, which pleases you all so much, will
be a very unhappy one&mdash;some day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You think what you wish&mdash;all men do,&rsquo; said
his wife. &lsquo;I have not a doubt that it will be
perfectly happy&mdash;as happy as any marriage is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that is to say. She will adore him; men like
to be adored. You can only get that from somebody
very young. He will never say an unkind
word to her, and he will never object, however
much she may spend. If she cannot be content
with that&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Duc laughed derisively.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Gold! gold! gold! That is the joy of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cabotine</i>, not of Yseulte de Valogne. What
she will want will be love, and he will not give
it her. With all deference to you, I see the
materials for a very sombre poem in your
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">épopée</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I repeat, your wish is father to your
thought. On the theatres women do rebel, and
stab themselves, or other people, but in real life
they are very much more pliable. In a year&rsquo;s
time she will not care in the least about Othmar
himself, but she will have grown to like the
world and the life that she leads in it. She
will have learnt to amuse herself; she will not
fret if he pass his time elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are entirely wrong,&rsquo; said de Vannes,
with irritation. &lsquo;She is a child now, but in a
few weeks she will be a woman. Then he will
find that you cannot light a fire on grass and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
leave the earth unscorched. She has the blood
of Gui de Valogne. She will not be a saint
always. If she find herself neglected, she will
not forgive it when she shall understand what
it means. If he be her lover after marriage, all
may be well; I do not say the contrary. But
if he neglect her then, as he neglects her
now&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray, do not put such follies into her head.
Neglected! When not a day passes that he
does not send her the most marvellous presents,
does not empty on her half the jewellers&rsquo; cases
out of Europe and Asia.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He makes up in jewels what he wants in
warmth,&rsquo; said Alain de Vannes. &lsquo;At present
she is a baby, a little saint, an innocent; as
ignorant as her ivory Madonna; but in six
months&rsquo; time she will be very different. She
will know that she belongs to a man who does
not care for her; she will want all that he
does not give her; she will be like a rich red
rose opening where all is ice&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You go to the theatres till you get melodramatic,&rsquo;
said his wife, with contempt. &lsquo;I do
not believe she will ever have any passions at
all; she will always be the ivory saint.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Alain de Vannes laughed grimly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Women who are beautiful and have good
health are never saints,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and saints are
not married at sixteen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Françoise Romaine was,&rsquo; said his wife,
who always had the last word in any discussion.</p>

<p>Othmar was more restless than he had ever
been in his life, more dissatisfied, and more impatient
of fate. Yet he was not sure that he
would have undone what he had done, even if
honour would have allowed him.</p>

<p>The tenderness which Yseulte had awakened
in him, though it could not compete with the
passion another had aroused in him, made him
feel a charm in her presence, a solace in her
youthfulness. The restrictions imposed on their
intercourse sustained the mystic spiritual grace
which the young girl had in his eyes, and it
prevented any possible chance of disillusion or
of fatigue on his part. Hers was really the
virginal purity, as of a white rosebud which
has blossomed in the shade. He was not insensible
to its beauty, even whilst a beauty of
another kind had fuller empire upon him. He
had done an unwise thing, but he said to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>self
continually, &lsquo;At least I have made one innocent
creature happy, and surely I shall be
able to continue to do so; she can hardly be
more difficult to content than a dove or a fawn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He forgot, as so many men do forget, that
in this life, which seemed to him like the dove&rsquo;s,
like the fawn&rsquo;s, there would be all the latent
ardours of womanhood; that in the folded
rosebud there was the rose-tinted heart, in
which the bee would sting. They met at ceremonies,
banquets, great family réunions, solemn
festivities, in which all the Faubourg took part.
She was intensely, exquisitely, happy when she
was conscious that he was near her, but she
was as silent as a statue and as timid as a
bird when he looked at her or addressed her.
Every day, every hour, was increasing what
was to become the one absorbing passion of
her life, but he was too indifferent, or too
engrossed by other thoughts, to note the
growth of this innocent love. Alain de Vannes
saw much more of it than he.</p>

<p>She had the spiritual loveliness for him
which S. Cecilia had in the eyes of the Roman
centurion who wedded with her; a more delicate
and more ethereal charm than that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
only springs from the provocation of the senses.
A caress to her seemed almost a profanity: to
disturb her innocent soul with the grossness of
earthly love seemed like a sort of sacrilege.</p>

<p>The whole of this time was a period of
restless doubt with him, and the sense that he
had not been honest with her rebuked him
whenever he met the timid worship of her
wistful eyes. He thought, &lsquo;She would not give
herself to me, if she knew!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was impatient to have all the tumult
and folly which precede a great marriage over
and done with. Every detail annoyed him;
every formula irritated him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All I entreat is, that there may be no
delay,&rsquo; he said so often to her cousin, that
Madame de Vannes ended in believing that
he must be much more enamoured than his
manner had betokened, and said with amusement
to her husband:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It has often been disputed whether a man
can be in love with two persons at one time:
Othmar is so, unquestionably. It is like the
bud and the fruit on the same bough of
camellia.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is to be hoped that when the bud is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
flower the fruit will fall,&rsquo; said de Vannes, with
a grim smile.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are not sincere when you say that,&rsquo;
said the Duchesse, &lsquo;and you know that both
always fall&mdash;after a time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A law of nature,&rsquo; said her husband. &lsquo;And
it is a law of nature also that others come in
their place.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear friend,&rsquo; said Aurore de Vannes,
with good-natured contempt, &lsquo;when Yseulte
shall have followed the laws of nature in that
way, believe me, it is not you who will profit
by them. You were good-looking ten years
ago&mdash;or more&mdash;but absinthe and bacarat does
not improve the looks after five-and-twenty, and
you have crow&rsquo;s-feet already, and will soon
have to dye your hair if you wish still to look
young. Yseulte will never think of you except
as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vieux cousin</i> who was kind enough to give
her a locket&mdash;if she will even do that when she
has got all the diamonds that she will get as
Countess Othmar.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Meantime, Othmar himself was constantly
saying to the Duchesse:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I put myself completely in your hands;
only, all I beseech of you, Madame, is not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
delay my marriage longer than you are absolutely
obliged.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He does not say his happiness,&rsquo; thought
Madame de Vannes, as she said aloud, &lsquo;Well,
what will seem terrible to you? I think I
ought to exact a delay of at least six months.
She is so very young.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is her youth that is delightful to me,&rsquo; he
replied abruptly. &lsquo;I am old enough to need
its charm. I should be glad if you would consent
to our nuptials very soon&mdash;say within a
fortnight. I have already instructed my solicitors
to meet you and to make whatever settlements
you and the Duc de Vannes may desire
upon Mademoiselle de Valogne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What! carte blanche?&rsquo; thought Cri-Cri,
with a wonder which she took care to conceal,
whilst she objected that such speed as he desired
was impossible, was quite unheard of, would be
indecorous: there were so many things to be
done; but in the end she relented, consented to
name that day month, and reflected that he
should pay for his haste in the marriage contract.
It would make no difference to herself
whether he settled ten millions or ten pence
on her young cousin, but it seemed to her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
she was not doing her duty unless, in condescending
to ally herself with la Finance, she
did not shear its golden fleeces unscrupulously.</p>

<p>In her own mind she reflected that it was
as well the marriage should take place speedily,
for she perceived that his heart was not much
in it. She divined that some alien motive
actuated him in his desire for it, and she would
have regretted if any breach had occurred to
prevent it; for, although she professed to her
intimate friends that she disliked the alliance
excessively, she was nevertheless very gratified
at her own relative having borne off such a
great prize as Othmar. One never knew either
how useful such a connection as his might not
become.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would never have let her marry into
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Juiverie</i>,&rsquo; she said to her husband. &lsquo;But
Othmar is quite different; his mother was an
English duke&rsquo;s daughter, his grandmother was a
de Soissons-Valette, he has really good blood.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And besides that,&rsquo; said de Vannes savagely,
&lsquo;he is a man whom all Europe has sighed to
marry ever since he came of age. Why do
you talk such nonsense to me? It is waste of
good acting!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;As you wasted your medallion,&rsquo; said his
wife, with a malicious enjoyment. &lsquo;If she had
taken the veil, you would have been quite
capable of eloping with her, the very infamy of
the action would have delighted you. But
Othmar will certainly not let you make love to
his wife; he is just the sort of man to be
jealous.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of Nadine Napraxine, not of his own
wife!&rsquo; said de Vannes, with an angry laugh.
&lsquo;Marry them quickly, while he is in the mind,
and before Madame Napraxine can spoil the
thing. In six months&rsquo; time he will return to
her, but that will not matter; our little cousin
will be Countess Othmar, and will probably
learn to console herself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are not hopeless?&rsquo; said his wife,
much amused. &lsquo;Well, I do not think with
you. I believe that Nadine Napraxine has
never been anything to Othmar; that the child,
on the contrary, is passionately in love with
him; and that the marriage will be a very
happy one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Alain de Vannes shrugged his shoulders.
He was very angry that the matter had turned
out as it had done; the more angry that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
wholly impossible for him to display or to
express his discomfiture, and that he was compelled
to be amiable to Othmar and to all the
world in relation to it, and bear himself before
everyone as the friend and guardian of his
wife&rsquo;s cousin. His fancy for her had been a
caprice rather than anything stronger, but it
was resentful in its disappointment and impotence,
and might even be capable of some
vengeance.</p>

<p>Faïel had left sweet, solemn memories with
the girl: the green gloom of the fern-brakes
and the wooded lanes, the soft grey summers,
and the evenings with their mysterious silvery
shadows; the silent corridors, the tolling bells,
the altars with their white lilies, the pathetic
monotonous voices of the nuns&mdash;all were blent
together in her recollection into a picture full
of holiness and calm. Now that she knew
what the gipsy woman had meant, she wished
to be there for a little while to muse upon her
vast happiness, her wondrous future, and consecrate
them both.</p>

<p>She asked for, and obtained, permission to
go to her old convent in retreat for the two
weeks before her marriage. Madame de Vannes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
was inclined to refuse what she regarded as
excessive and eccentric, but Othmar obtained
her consent.</p>

<p>It pleased him that she should pass her
time before her marriage with the holy women
who had trained her childhood; it was not so
that Nadine Napraxine had spent the weeks
preceding her soulless union.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You wish not to see her for two whole
weeks?&rsquo; said the Duchesse, suspiciously.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish her to do always what she wishes,&rsquo;
he answered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She will be a very happy woman then,&rsquo;
said Cri-Cri, drily.</p>

<p>He added, with a little hesitation: &lsquo;It is
her unlikeness to the world, her spirituality,
which has charmed me; I wish her to retain
them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It will be difficult,&rsquo; said the Duchesse, with
a laugh. &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fillette</i>,&rsquo; she said with amusement
to her young cousin, &lsquo;I do not know why you
are so very solemn about it all; I assure you
the soul has very little to do with marriage, as
you will find out soon enough. Why should
you go in retreat as if you were about to enter
religion?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Yseulte coloured; she answered timidly:
&lsquo;I am forgetting God; it is ungrateful; I am
too happy; I mean&mdash;I grow selfish, I want to
be quiet a little while to remember&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Duchesse laughed, much amused:
&lsquo; You ought decidedly to have taken the veil;
you will be a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">religieuse manquée</i>! At your age
I thought of nothing but of my balls and my
bouquets, and of the costumes they gave me,
and of the officers of the Guides&mdash;Alain was in
the Guides, he was very good-looking at that
time. I must say Othmar and you are like no
lovers in the world that I have ever known.&rsquo;</p>

<p>However, she gave her permission, and
Yseulte went to the ancient stonebuilt fortress-like
house of Faïel, where the quiet corridors
were filled with the smell of dried herbs from
the nuns&rsquo; distillery and the little grey figures of
the children played noiselessly under the leafless
chestnut avenues of the tranquil gardens.</p>

<p>It was all so welcome to her after the
babble of Blanchette, the tumult of congratulation,
the succession of compliments, the perpetual
sense of being exhibited and examined, discussed
and depreciated; but it did not change
her thoughts very much, for even in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
prayers her wondrous change of fate always
seemed with her, and she found that even
amongst her pious and unworldly Dames de
Ste. Anne the betrothed of Count Othmar was
received as a very different being to the dowerless
Yseulte de Valogne; and something of
that bitterness which so often came to her
lover reached her through all her guilelessness.
Even Nicole, also, embracing her with ardour
and tenderness, with the tears running down
her brown cheeks, and pleading for the right
to send her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pétiote</i> the orange-blossoms and
the lilies-of-the-valley for her bridal-dress, yet
amidst her joyful tears and tearful joy had
not forgotten to whisper: &lsquo;And, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dis donc, ma
mignonne</i>, you will say a word now to the
Count Othmar to get my husband the municipal
concession to put up the steam mill? It will
make our fortune, my angel, and I know what
a happiness that will be to you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A fortune! Money, money! It seems
all they think of in the world!&rsquo; the child
reflected sadly. &lsquo;What can Nicole and Sandroz
want with more money? They are very
well off, and they have no children, no relations
even; and yet all they think about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
is laying by one napoleon on the top of
another! It is horrible! Even the Mother
Superior has never said to me how good he
is, how kind, how generous; she only says that
I am fortunate because he is so rich! They
make me feel quite wicked. I want to tell
them how mean they are! Why am I so
much better and greater in their sight because
I am going to become rich too? I thought
they cared for none of those things. But our
Reverend Mother asks me for a new altar
service as Blanchette asked me for a turquoise
necklace! I understand why he is always a
little sad. He thinks no one cares for him, for
himself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And, after many days and nights of most
anxious thought and most entreating prayer,
she gathered up all her courage and wrote a
little letter to Othmar, the only one which she
had ever addressed to him; she was afraid it
was a strange thing to do, and one perhaps
unmaidenly, but she could not resist her longing
to say that one thing to him, and so she
wrote:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Monsieur,&mdash;I do not know whether I
ought to say it, and I hope you will forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
me if it be wrong to say so, but I have thought
often since I hear and see so much of your
great wealth that perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you may
imagine it is that which I care for; but indeed
I do not; if you were quite poor, very poor
to-morrow, it would be just the same to me,
and I should be just as happy. I do pray you
to believe this.</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Yours, in affection and reverence,<br />
&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Yseulte</span>.&rsquo; <br />
</p>

<p>She had hesitated very long before she
ventured to sign herself so, but in the end it
seemed to her that it could not be very
wrong as it stood: she owed him both affection
and reverence&mdash;even the Mother Superior
herself would say so.</p>

<p>She enclosed the little note in a letter to
her cousin the Duchesse, knowing that otherwise
it would not be allowed to pass the convent
walls. When Madame de Vannes received it
she looked at it with suspicion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If it should be any nonsense about Nadine
Napraxine?&rsquo; she thought with alarm; &lsquo;if it
should be any folly that would break the marriage?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>She decided that it would be unwise to
send it to Othmar without knowing what it
said, so she broke the little seal very carefully
and read it. Something in it touched her as
she perused the simple words, written so evidently
with a hand which trembled and a heart
that was full. She sealed it again and despatched
it to its destination. &lsquo;Poor little simpleton,&rsquo;
she thought, &lsquo;why did she take the
trouble to say that? She will not make him
believe it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But he did believe it.</p>

<p>It was because she made the belief possible
to him that the child had seemed to him like
a young angel who brought healing on her
wings; and the love which did not venture to
avow itself, but yet was visible in every one
of these timid sentences, went to his heart with
sweetness and unconscious reproach. He wrote
back to her:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I believe you, and I thank you. You give
me what the world cannot give nor command.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And he added words of tenderness which,
if they would have seemed cold to an older or
a less innocent recipient, wholly contented her,
and seemed to her like a breath from heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The fortnight soon passed, and after its quiet
days at Faïel, filled with the sounds so familiar
to her of the drowsy bells, the rolling organ
swell, the plaintive monotonous chaunts and
prayers, the pacing of slow steps up and down
long stone passages, the grinding of the winch
of the great well in the square court, she felt
calmed and strengthened, and not afraid when
the Mother Superior spoke of all the responsibilities
of her future.</p>

<p>To her, marriage was a mystic, spiritual
union; all she knew of it was gathered from
the expressions borrowed from it to symbolise
the union of Christ and His saints. She went
to it with as religious and innocent a faith as
she would have taken with her to the cloister
had they sent her there. If any human creature
can be as pure as snow, a very young girl who
has been reared by simple and pious women
is so. Even the Duchesse de Vannes felt a
vague emotion before that absolute ignorance
of the senses and of the passions of life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is stupid,&rsquo; she said to herself. &lsquo;But it
is lovely in its way. I can fancy a man likes
to destroy it&mdash;slowly, cruelly&mdash;just as a boy
pulls off butterflies&rsquo; wings.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>The first days of February came all too soon
for the vague fears of Yseulte, which throbbed
in her as the heart beats in a bird which feels a
captor&rsquo;s hand approaching. All the ridicule of
Blanchette and Toinon, all the good-natured
banter of their mother, and all the endless
congratulations of society which rained on her
like the almond blossoms which were falling in
showers in the wind, could not make her otherwise
than bewildered and alarmed, and as the
time of her marriage drew closer and closer her
terror almost obscured her happiness. No one
would have believed in it; everyone, had they
known the secrets of her shy and silent mind,
would have laughed at it as hypocrisy; but
with her it was most real.</p>

<p>Away from Othmar, she adored him; but
near him, she dreaded him as a stranger who
was about to lead her into the strangest and
most terrible mysteries of life. But time stays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
not for the sinking or the fluttering of any
poor human heart, and they brought her from
the dim, cold, misty Breton country back into
the gay and crowded world of Paris; and the
great rooms of her cousin&rsquo;s house, filled by
brilliant throngs for the signing of the contract,
brought home to her the inexorable fact
that her marriage would itself take place in
another forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are so pale, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fillette</i>!&rsquo; said the Duchesse
in some impatience. &lsquo;One would think that
we were forcing your inclinations!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte said nothing; she could not have
explained the tumult of agitation which was
in her. She was marvellously happy; and
yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A lover who had loved her would have
divined and penetrated all those mingled
emotions, which were unintelligible to herself;
but Othmar was too <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distrait</i> and too absorbed
in thought, wherein she had no share, to do so.
Though she was the centre of the world around
her for the moment, the child remained in an
absolute solitude.</p>

<p>Friederich Othmar, studying her with his
exquisite power of penetration, alone perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
her trouble, and thought with pleasure: &lsquo;The
poets are not quite the fools I deemed them;
there <em>is</em> such a thing as a virginal soul in which
the senses do not speak, and to which the gewgaws
of the world say nothing either. I should
never have believed that, but I see it. He has
found a pearl, but he will not care for it. He
will absorb it into the acid of his own disappointed
passions, and then will be surprised
if it disappear.&rsquo;</p>

<p>If he had been told a month earlier that he
would have had such sentimental regrets, he
would have been wholly incredulous, but something
in the sight of the young girl, in her innocent
gravity, with her wistful, changeful eyes,
touched him, as she stood by the table where
the marriage contract was signed. She seemed
to him too good to be wedded with indifference,
taught the fever of passion, the suffering
of maternity, and then be forsaken&mdash;as she
would be.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am glad that I did not meet her, or one
like her, thirty years ago; she would have
unnerved me,&rsquo; he thought, as he stooped and
wrote his own name.</p>

<p>Amongst the nuptial gifts had been one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
great value from the Princess Napraxine. It
was a gold statuette of Love, modelled by
Mercié and standing on a base of jade and
agate. It had all the cruelty and irony of the
modern Italian school in it, for the poor Amorino
was trying to drink out of a gourd which was
empty, and the expression of his disappointed,
distressed, pathetic features was rendered with
admirable mockery and skill. He turned his
sad eyes ruefully on those who looked at him;
some withered passion-flowers and a little asp
were near his feet. When Othmar saw it, his
face darkened; he thought it a jest at himself,
nor had the giver selected it without intention.
Behind the gold Amorino he seemed to see her
smiling, serene, jewel-like eyes, her delicate,
contemptuous mouth, which said: &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Va donc!
C&rsquo;est le vieux jeu!</i>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The only woman that I shall ever love!&rsquo;
he thought with a thrill of remorse, of shame,
and of anger, all in one.</p>

<p>What right had he, while his veins were
hot with those unholy fires, to simulate love
for an innocent and virgin life?</p>

<p>The morning came for which Blanchette and
Toinon had been longing for a month; and clothed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
in palest blue velvet, carrying white bouquets as
large as themselves, they wore at their throats
the new diamond lockets of their ambition,
with the miniature of their cousin within each,
for which they cared nothing at all. But the
diamonds were as large and as numerous as
ever their hearts could desire. &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vrai! Il est
bon prince!</i>&rsquo; they cried in chorus, as they
skipped round each other, and made the sun
sparkle in the jewels, and sang the song of
Judic.</p>

<p>Then they went to the church of S. Philippe
du Roule, and made their little naughty faces
as grave as mice that see a cat, while the
incense rose and the organ pealed, and the
Latin words rolled out sonorously, and the pale
wintry sunshine shone over the brilliant crowd
assembled there for the marriage.</p>

<p>Yseulte herself looked like a slender white
lily.</p>

<p>The deep peace and serenity of her convent
days had come there with her; certain
instincts of her race kept her still and composed
with the eyes of so many strangers upon her; a
dignity that was exquisitely graceful blended
with her childish air; she looked like some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
young princess of the Valois time, such as
poets and painters still see in their dreams.</p>

<p>One of those special trains which Blanchette
thought the supreme privilege of marriage bore
them without a pause through the wintry landscapes
between Paris and Blois.</p>

<p>The day was fine and windless; there was
a scent of spring which breathed through the
leafless poplars and willows, and over the frosted
fields and vineyards, with sweet, vague promise;
here and there burst in to sight, out from a
forest glade beside some château, some gaily-clad
hunting party, the last of the season; ever
and anon there was some little town, with its
old ruined castle, or its monastic church, shut
in, in leafless orchards. The broad river glistened
in the light under the burden of its many
islands, its breaking blocks of ice drifting on
turbid green waters, its flood of mud and melted
snow rolling heavily beneath the colliers and
the merchant craft, which made their way
slowly against the floes. In the drear blackened
vineyards, peasants, like pictures by Millet,
were at work; sometimes a woman with faggots
on her bowed shoulders straightened herself to
watch the swiftness of the train, or a blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>frocked
herd-boy stopped his cattle at a crossing.</p>

<p>All these pictures passed before the eyes of
Yseulte like the panorama of a dream: the
early morning hours had been one long bewilderment
to her; though she had carried
herself so bravely, her heart had beaten all
the while like a caught bird&rsquo;s: even now the
scent of the incense, the waves of sound from
the organ, the sonorous voice of the great prelate
in its admonitions, seemed to come with
her into the still, brown, fresh country; the
sense of some infinite and solemn obligation,
accepted and irrevocable, was upon her.</p>

<p>They had left Paris immediately after the
ceremony; and the evening sun was glowing
in the west and lighting the pastoral country
with its leafless woods and glancing rivers as
they reached the château.</p>

<p>Amyôt was a place of great beauty and
stateliness; it had been built for François
Premier, and had the salamander and the
crown carved on its stones and blazoned on
its metal work; it was surrounded by water
like Chenonceaux, and in the sunset-glow its
pinnacles and towers and high steep roof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
gleamed as if made of gold; it stood on a hill
amidst great woods, overlooking the fruitful
valleys and fertile plains which lie between the
Loire and Cher, and in its gardens all the art
that modern horticulture can boast was united
to the stately avenues, the close-shorn turf, the
long grey stone terraces with the motto of the
Valois and the fleur-de-lis of France carved upon
their pilasters, which had in their day seen
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mignons</i> of Henri II., and felt the feet of
Diane de Poitiers and of Mary Stuart.</p>

<p>Amyôt was a poem, epic and epopee
in one; she had never seen it before; she
gazed at it with entranced eyes, glad that her
home would be in such a place; then she
looked timidly at Othmar.</p>

<p>He was not looking at her.</p>

<p>She sighed, hardly knowing why, but with
a vague sense of neglect and disappointment.
She was in a trance of mingled joy and dread.
She saw the dusky avenue of yews through
which they passed, the long lines of majestic
terraces, the sheets of glancing water, the
masses of camellias and azaleas, brought from
the hothouses to make the wintry gardens
bloom for that momentous hour, the vast fan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>tastic
solemn pile towering up against the
evening skies. She saw them all as in a dream;
she was wondering wistfully in her ignorance
whether it were possible that she had offended
him, or possible that already he regretted what
he had done. She shrank a little from him,
and sat quite silent as their carriage rolled
under the great stone gateway.</p>

<p>There had been enough in his caresses, in
his words, as they had come thither, to startle
her innocent ignorance into some sense of the
meaning and the demands of love, but they had
left her dimly alarmed and troubled, as before
some great mystery, and he had soon grown
abstracted, almost indifferent, and had abandoned
himself to his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Amyôt even in its winter silence and
sombreness, was a place where lovers could
well forget the world; yews and bay trees made
perpetual verdure around its lawns, and orangeries
and palm-houses made ceaseless summer
within its walls; in its halls and galleries old
tapestries and Eastern hangings muffled every
sound and excluded every draught; and in the
warm air of its chambers, ceiled with cedar-wood,
embossed with the salamander, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
&lsquo;F.&rsquo; in solid gold, and having embayed windows,
all looking straightway south over the Loire
water, the winter&rsquo;s landscape, seen through
its painted casements, was but as a decorative
scene set there for the strong charm of contrast.</p>

<p>They passed through the ranks of the
bowing servants, and remained at last alone in
the great suite of drawing-rooms, whose oriel
windows all looked southward. They were
rooms hung with pale satins, still ceiled with
cedar, and keeping the Valois crown and arms
upon their gilded carvings and lofty archways.
They preserved the style and charm of the age
which had begotten them. She was in harmony
with them as she moved there, the dull red light
which preceded evening falling through the
painted panes on the dove-hued velvet and
dusky furs of her travelling-gown, and touching
the light gold of her fair hair coiled in a great
knot above her throat.</p>

<p>He, when his servants had retired, kissed
her hand with a ceremony which seemed, even
to her innocence, very cold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are at home,&rsquo; he said gently. &lsquo;Here
it will be for you to command, for all to obey.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She stood before him in one of the em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>brasures
of the windows; the cream-hued
velvet of her travelling-dress trimmed with
sable, caught the rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are châtelaine of Amyôt,&rsquo; he added,
with a smile. &lsquo;Here I shall be but the first
of your servants.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The words were gracious, and even tender,
but they touched her with a sense of chillness;
she felt, without knowing why she felt
it, that it was not with this courteous ceremony
that he would have welcomed her if he
had loved her&mdash;much.</p>

<p>She said nothing, though she coloured a
little as he kissed her hands.</p>

<p>She moved to one of the great windows
and looked out a little wistfully towards the
rolling waters, the deep, dark brown forests
with their purple shadows. The dim afternoon
light spread over the landscape without, and
through the gorgeous and majestic chambers,
which had once heard the love words of
the Valois. She had laid her hat down on a
table near, the lingering glow of the dying
day fell on her white throat, on her cheek
with its changing colour, on the knot of orange
blossom fastened amongst the lace at her breast;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
she thrilled through all her nerves as she
suddenly realised that she was altogether his,
to be used as he chose, never to be apart from
him unless by his wish.</p>

<p>She gazed at the scene around her, troubled,
perplexed, wistfully, vaguely alarmed, afraid
she knew not of what; whilst he watched her
with a certain futile anger against himself that
her loveliness did not excite him and content
him more, a remorseful sense that he was not
the lover she merited and should have won.</p>

<p>A sort of self-reproach moved him as he
looked at her in her innocence, which seemed
too holy a thing to be profaned by the grossness
of sensual approach&mdash;on the morrow she
would not look at him with those serene, childlike
eyes.</p>

<p>It seemed to him almost cruel to rouse that
perfect innocence from its unsuspicious repose.</p>

<p>Before he could speak again she had turned
towards him; her lips trembled a little as she
gathered her courage and said aloud what had
been in her thoughts all the day through.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It will be for me to obey,&rsquo; she murmured,
with the colour deepening in her cheeks. &lsquo;And
I will do it always, so gladly: but would you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
tell me one thing: did you&mdash;I mean&mdash;if you
had not cared for me a little, surely you would
never have wished&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She paused, overcome by the sense of her
own hardihood, and her eyes filled with tears;
she longed to say to him, &lsquo;Instead of all your
jewels, instead of all this luxury, give me one
fond word,&rsquo; but her timidity and her modesty
would not let her lips frame the supplication.
He was still as a stranger to her&mdash;a man whom
she had seen scarce a dozen times.</p>

<p>The question in its timid commencement had
said enough: his conscience shrank from it;
he had always dreaded the moment inevitable
of the fatal&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

    <p>&lsquo;If this be love, tell me how much.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>&lsquo;Would you tell me?&rsquo; she repeated very
low, then paused with an overwhelming sense
of her own hardihood and great immodesty.</p>

<p>She made a beautiful picture as she stood
before him; the cream-hued satin falling about
her, the warm cedar-wood panels behind her,
the red light of the sunset shed like a glory
upon her head and shining about her feet.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who would not love you, dear?&rsquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
murmured, with a hesitation of which her own
confusion spared her from being conscious.
&lsquo;Never doubt my affection. I have not been
as happy as the world thinks me, but if I
be not happy beside you, fate will indeed find
me thankless.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nor was it altogether untrue; she looked
infinitely lovely to him in that moment, with
the tears shining in her upraised eyes, and the
blue veins of her throat swelling where the
orange flowers touched them; and all this was
his&mdash;his as wholly as the budding primrose in
the woods is the child&rsquo;s that finds it and may
pluck and rifle it at will.</p>

<p>An emotion that was more nearly passion
than he had hitherto felt for her moved him
as he looked on her.</p>

<p>With a sudden impulse of the joy and
mastery of possession, warmer and more eager
than any she had roused in him before, he
took her in his arms and kissed her throat
where the orange flowers were fastened, and,
with a tender touch, unloosed them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
</div>


<p>&lsquo;Othmar <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filant le parfait amour</i> while he
gathers wet violets under his Valois woods, is a
truly admirable idyl!&rsquo; said the Princess Napraxine,
with her unkind little smile, a month
later, while her eyes, from under an umbrella
covered with old point duchesse, went indolently
from the shining sea upon her right
to the romantic gorge leading up to distant
peaks of snow, which could be seen on
her left through boughs of eucalyptus and
mimosa. She was seated on the white
terraces of a famous villa, crowning a promontory
which carried luxuriant and fantastic
gardens far out into the lazy blue water, across
whose then smiling plains of azure light it
looked straight southward to the cloud which
was Corsica. It was the villa of another Russian
magnate, Prince Ezarhédine, with whom
there was at that time staying a mighty statesman
at whose nod or frown Europe breathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
lightly or held her breath; and under the guise
of a breakfast there was an informal conference
of diplomatists at his house that day.</p>

<p>Friederich Othmar was staying at S. Pharamond
for two days to meet the great Russian,
and conduct, over a cigarette and a glass of
kümmel, one of those delicate and intricate
negotiations in which finance and diplomacy
had equal parts, and which were the delight of
his soul, and made the special fame of the
House of Othmar.</p>

<p>The great statesman was a charming person,
Oriental in morals, Athenian in mind, and
French in manners; and Nadine Napraxine,
who so seldom could be persuaded to go anywhere,
had deigned to come and breakfast
with him there and allow him to recall her
childhood.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You would never give me a smile,&rsquo; he said
to her. &lsquo;At five years old you were as cruel
as you are now. I remember taking you what
I thought an irresistible bribe; a gardener in
Saxe driving a wheelbarrow of bonbons.
But you just looked at it&mdash;smileless&mdash;and said
cruelly, &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci, Monsieur&mdash;mais j&rsquo;en ai tant!</i>&rdquo;
You were five years old then.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tant</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trop</i>&rdquo; are the spoilers of our
existence,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I remember as a child
I never cared for bonbons; I used to say that
if they hung up where the church bells were,
and one could not get them, one would
care&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My intention was good,&rsquo; said the great
man piteously; &lsquo;you might have smiled on me
for that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That would have been very commonplace,
everybody is amiable in that kind of way; I
am not amiable, they say, and yet I am never
out of temper&mdash;which seems to me the first requisite
for amiability.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Serenity is unkind when it means indifference.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But indifference is so comfortable to the
indifferent!&rsquo; she had replied, and the reply
admitted of no refutation.</p>

<p>Now, when the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déjeuner</i>, which had been
the pretext and cover of the morning&rsquo;s informal
but pregnant discussion, was over, and she was
about to go to her carriage, she had smiled
with gentle condescension on the Baron, and
asked him the tidings of Amyôt. Friederich
Othmar, in his answers, had been incautiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and unusually enthusiastic in the hearing of
a person who to all enthusiasm was merciless;
the more merciless, because in a far-down and
never-investigated corner of her own nature she
was a little conscious that she also could have
been enthusiastic&mdash;if it had been worth while.</p>

<p>She had laughed a little unkindly, and had
made the remark about the wet violets; the
Baron, slightly irritated and considerably in
earnest, had replied, that to gather violets with
your own wife was less exciting, but perhaps
sweeter, and certainly wiser, than to purchase
orchids for the wife of someone else.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A most moral opinion, turned with classic
elegance, and quite indisputable,&rsquo; said Madame
Napraxine, with much amusement. &lsquo;And
orchids are so short-lived! Do you think home-grown
violets live longer? Dear Baron, I am
so glad to see you so pleased, and so poetical;
Napoleon&rsquo;s desire for an heir made him quite
brutal; your desire for your nephew&rsquo;s heir
makes you quite full of pretty sentiment. Pray
go on, you interest me! it is as if one heard
Bismarck playing a guitar!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Like Napoleon, I dislike <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les amours
stériles</i>,&rsquo; replied Friederich Othmar, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
smile. &lsquo;My nephew was in danger of letting
his life drift away in a dream; I know no
means of recalling a man to the practical
happiness of existence so efficacious as a young
girl&rsquo;s beauty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very primitive in your ideas, dear
Baron, for a person who has lived all his life
in Paris,&rsquo; said the Princess Nadine, with her
little air of fatigue and of irony. She knew
very well what had been implied in his words,
and she resented them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nature is primitive, Madame,&rsquo; said the
Baron. &lsquo;But after all, we do not improve on
her, nor exclude her, do what we may.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You think not?&rsquo; said Madame Napraxine,
much amused. &lsquo;Well, for my part, I have
never been able to discover that Nature is very
charming: if we attended to her, she would
make us eat with our fingers, fight with our
teeth, drink only water, and wear no clothes;
she would certainly, also, give Otho Othmar a
score of wives instead of one Sainte Mousseline.
Do not take to admiring Nature, Baron; she
will lead you astray. It is too late for you to
begin; no one after twenty can eat green fruit
with impunity.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Sainte Mousseline!&rsquo; echoed the old man,
with more temper than prudence. &lsquo;Surely that
epithet would not apply to Yseulte!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course not now,&rsquo; said Nadine, serenely.
&lsquo;Sainte Mousseline has given way to the nuptial
white satin. Only you spoke of Nature;&mdash;and
if I were you I would not wish for Nature
to prevail too much at Amyôt, for Nature has
a sad trick of being soon satisfied, and dissatisfied,
and disposed to change. You know
it is only the poets who invented Constancy, at
the same time that they created the Ph&oelig;nix and
the Hippogriff.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I thought he could be unfaithful to so
much youth and so much innocence&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo; began
the Baron, with some heat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He will not be so yet, at all events,&rsquo; said
Prince Ezarhédine. &lsquo;Men are not quite so
fickle as Madame Nadine thinks.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Men are what women make them,&rsquo; she
replied, with her most contemptuous tranquillity.
&lsquo; As a rule, they are always faithless to women
who love them. It is tiresome to be loved;
&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ça vous donne des nerfs</i>.&rdquo; You get out of
temper and you go away; then silly people
say you are inconstant.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;You will admit that at least it seems very
like it,&rsquo; said Baron Fritz.</p>

<p>The great statesman, standing near, looked
a little wistfully at her. He thought that he
would not have found it tiresome to be loved
by the wife of Napraxine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Countess Othmar will be too young
to understand all that,&rsquo; continued Nadine.
&lsquo; She will give too much of herself. She will
not have the first essential: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir se reprendre</i>.
Love is like all other fine arts&mdash;it should be
treated scientifically. Do you remember Sergius
Veriatine? He was devoted to the Princess
Platoff&mdash;my cousin Sophie. All at once he
broke with her. Some one asked him why he
did so. He answered honestly: &ldquo;Un jour, elle
faisait la faute de me prier de rester quand je
voulais m&rsquo;en aller.&rdquo; Serge Veriatine put the
whole of male human nature into that sentence.
Othmar&rsquo;s wife will be always begging him to
stay when he will want to go; she is so young.
She is, of course, in love with him; very much
in love with him; and she is so unhappily inexperienced
that she will be sure to tell him so
a hundred times a day. Now, however pretty
a story is, still when you hear it very often it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
grows dull: you see she is beginning with an
immense mistake: Amyôt in the winter!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Amyôt is his choice as much as hers,&rsquo; said
Friederich Othmar. &lsquo;You know he always
liked solitude. They will be in Paris in the
first days of April&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Two months, or to speak precisely, seven
weeks, of Amyôt in midwinter is precisely the
mistake that a very young girl would be sure
to make,&rsquo; continued his tormentor. &lsquo;Amyôt
is a delightful place in its way; it is like a
page of Brantôme. I remember the admirable
hunting parties he gave there for the Orleans
princes. But all the same, seven whole weeks
of Amyôt in the rain of February and March
would damp any ardour that he might begin
with&mdash;do you think he began with very much?
What a pity there was no one to tell her that a
man is bored so soon! And Othmar is like
Chateaubriand; he is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grand ennuyé</i> just
because his ideals are so high that it is wholly
impossible to find anything like them anywhere.
I am quite sure that he has imagined in this
poor child an angel and a goddess; a kind of
Greek nymph and Christian virgin blent in one.
When he finds that she is only a child, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
had the narrowest of all educations, and is not
even a woman in her comprehension or her
sympathies, he will be intolerably wearied. If
they were in the world, the disillusion might
be postponed; at Amyôt it must come in
two days.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very clever, Madame,&rsquo; said the
Baron with some irritation, &lsquo;but even you may
perhaps for once be mistaken. She is very
young, as you say; but for that very reason
she will be like clay in his hands which he can
mould as he will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If he take the trouble to model it at all,&rsquo;
said Nadine Napraxine. &lsquo;If the sculptor do
not touch the clay, it lies in a lump neglected
till somebody else comes. She will not know,
I fear, how to tempt him to make anything of
her. Do you suppose they have taught her the
art of provocation in her Breton convent? She
will only sob aloud if he go away for an hour,
and be plunged into despair if his kisses be one
less in number. My dear Baron, you lost all
your wisdom when you failed to persuade
them to leave Amyôt. They say there is no
living woman who can be seen at sunrise after
a ball and keep her lover; I am sure there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
not one who can be shut up with a man for
two months in the country, in winter, and
retain his belief in her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very learned in these matters,&rsquo;
said the Baron, more and more irritated, &lsquo;and
yet everyone knows that the Princess Napraxine
has always herself despised all human affections!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is not necessary to have sat in the midst
of a maelstrom to have studied the laws of
whirlpools,&rsquo; said his tormentor. &lsquo;And what
have human affections to do with it? You
know as well as I do that humanity has only
caprices and passions, with their natural issue,
disillusions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Friederich Othmar thought of the terrace at
Amyôt and the face of Yseulte.</p>

<p>Walking with her a moment, alone, in the
afternoon sunshine, he had ventured on a word
of counsel.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear child, you are very young. Let
an old man tell you something. Otho has one
serious malady; nay, do not look so alarmed,
it is only the malady of his generation&mdash;caprice
and ennui. He has not an idea that he is
capricious, but he is so. Do not let his caprices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
pain you; but, as far as you can, vary with his
varying moods; I think that is the secret of
sympathy. Just now it is high noon with you;
so there are no shadows; but shadows will fall.
I want you to understand that. Otho is not
perfect; in a way, he is very weak, though he
has more intellect than most men. Do not
make a god of him. You will only spoil him
and blind yourself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And then she had looked at him with that
look which he recalled now as he sat by Nadine
Napraxine, and had said with a dignity of reproach
which had sat very prettily on her
youthfulness: &lsquo;If he have faults, I shall never
see them&mdash;you maybe sure of that; and if you
will tell me how to please him, I will never
think of myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Remembering this, the Baron, who had
never in his life cared greatly for any woman or
believed much in one, felt a restless anger
against the prophetess of woe.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When they predict fire they have already
laid the powder,&rsquo; he thought, impatiently.</p>

<p>Friederich Othmar was surprised himself at
the feeling of affection and of anxiety which
Yseulte had aroused in him. He had wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Othmar to marry that the race might be continued,
but he had never supposed that any
young girl would fill him with the solicitude
for her own welfare which she made him feel
for hers.</p>

<p>Women had always been <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la femelle de
l&rsquo;homme</i> with him; no more; he was astonished
at himself for being moved by a genuine
desire to secure for her those more subtle joys of
the soul which he had always derided. Before
her he felt ashamed of his own grosser convictions
(which a month before would have
been so confident) that she could want nothing
more than the riches her marriage conferred on
her. Though he had been a man of little feeling
he was not altogether without kindliness,
and his keen penetration told him that hers
was a nature which the glories and gewgaws
of the world would do very little to console if
its affections were starved or its higher instincts
humiliated, and the prophecies of Nadine Napraxine
but irritated him more because he
knew that her merciless intelligence was as a
seismographic pendulum which foretold truly
the convulsions of the future.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;S. Pharamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
would have been a more natural place to select
at this season. Amyôt is superb, but it must
be sunk fathoms deep in snow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is no snow; it was open weather,
and even mild,&rsquo; replied the Baron, who was
ready to declare that roses were blossoming in
the ditches of the Orleannais.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But why did he not come to S. Pharamond?
It is a paradise of azaleas and tulips
at the present moment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is a pretty place,&rsquo; he answered; &lsquo;but perhaps
more suggestive of Apates and Philotes
than of the true Eros.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The vicinity of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tripots</i> hardly accords
with the solemnity of Hymen? Do you mean
that?&rsquo; she said, with her enigmatical little
smile. &lsquo;Who would ever have thought to
live to hear Baron Friederich mention Eros!
Well, we will hope that the god for once will
be like the Salamander which is emblazoned,
and carved so liberally, all over Amyôt. We
will hope the fire that feeds him may not go
out; but I am afraid the motto really means
that what nourishes extinguishes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With that she rose and took herself and her
sunshade, with its point duchesse, and her mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>vellous
gown with its cascades of lace and soft
pale hues, like tea roses, her provocative languor,
and her admirable grace, from the
terraces of the Prince Ezarhédine. She was
followed by longing eyes and a silence which
was the truest of compliments. To more than
one there, the sun had set whenever she had
passed from their sight.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What makes the world of men so fanatic
about that woman?&rsquo; asked Friederich Othmar,
exhaling all the unspoken grievances of his own
soul in a rude grumble, as the sound of the
whirling wheels of her carriage died away.
&lsquo;Why? Why? There are numbers more
beautiful; few, perhaps, with so perfect a form,
yet there are some who equal her even in that.
She is as cruel as death, as cold as frost; no
one ever saw a flush on her cheek or a tear in
her eyes, and when she smiles it is like the
sirocco and the north wind blent together; and
yet there is no woman so blindly loved.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yet!&rsquo; echoed Prince Ezarhédine. &lsquo;Surely,
you should say &ldquo;therefore.&rdquo; The sirocco and
the north wind blent together are electric
shocks to the most sated senses.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; added the great statesman who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
his guest, &lsquo;and if it will not sound too pedantic,
I will add also why it is. She is to her lovers
very much what the worship of Isis became to
the Latins. She blends an infinite subtlety of
sentiment with an infinite potentiality of sensual
delight.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sensual! She is as cold as snow&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know; she has that sobriquet. But
every one feels what a paradise would lie
within if the snow were melted. Every
one hopes&mdash;more or less conscious or unconscious
of his hope&mdash;to pass that frosty barrier.
I think if Madame Napraxine ever loved any
man, she would make such a heaven for him
that he would be the most enviable of all
human beings. But it would only last a month;
perhaps six weeks. Although,&rsquo; he added, with
a faint sigh, &lsquo;it would be worth losing all the
rest of life to be the companion of those six
weeks.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I may differ with you, Prince, I would
say that, on the contrary, if ever Madame
Nadine can be touched to love she will be
most tenacious and most constant,&rsquo; said Ezarhédine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps too much so for the felicity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the person whom she might honour,&rsquo; added the
Baron with a smile that was a little impertinent.
He had always disliked and dreaded her; she
had wasted two years of his nephew&rsquo;s life, and
he shrewdly suspected that she was the cause of
Othmar&rsquo;s too slight ardour towards his young
wife.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the subject of their meditations
and desires was borne by her fleet horses over
the sea-road homeward to La Jacquemerille.
She felt astonished, irritated, offended at the
idyl of Amyôt. To have loved herself, and
then to be content shut up within the stone
walls of a country-house with a girl taken from
a convent!</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is like Gilles de Retz,&rsquo; she thought,
with bitter disdain. &lsquo;He takes the white flesh
of a child to try and cure his malady.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to her cowardly, sensual, contemptible.</p>

<p>She drove homeward through the olives
and the lemon-yards and the green fields
that were full of anemones and narcissus and
of the bright gold and sea-shell hues of the
crocus. The grey towers of S. Pharamond
were on her left as she went, and beyond them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the fantastic pinnacles and gilded crockets of
Millo. She looked at them with an anger
foreign to her character.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who could have dreamed he would have
done so absurd a thing?&rsquo; she thought, irritated
against him and against herself. Never before
in her life had the actions of any other person
had the slightest effect upon her own feelings.
She had not lived very long, it is true, but
to herself she seemed to have an illimitable
experience; and within her memory there was
no record of any time in which she had cared
one straw what another did. That she should
care now, ever so slightly, irritated her pride
and wounded her delicacy. She was a woman
at all times truthful with herself, however it
might be her amusement to mislead others.
She was quite as cruel to herself as to anyone
else in her unrelenting and inquisitive mental
dissection. She pursued her self-analysis with
a mercilessness which, had she been less witty
and less worldly, might have been morbid; and
she did not disguise from herself now that the
tidings of Amyôt were an irritation if not a pain
to her. She did full justice to the loveliness
with which Othmar had sought to find oblivion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
of her own; and she knew that it might very
well be that, as the Baron had said, he had
become the girl&rsquo;s lover as well as her husband.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Men are such poor creatures,&rsquo; she thought
with scorn. &lsquo;They are all the slaves of their
senses; they have no character; they are only
animals. They talk of their souls, but they
have got none; and of their constancy, but
they are only constant to their own self-indulgence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The contempt of a woman, in whom the
senses have never awakened, and for whom all
the grosser appetites have no attraction, for
those easy consolations which men can find in
the mere gratification of those appetites, is very
real and very unforgiving.</p>

<p>Her scorn for Othmar, seeking forgetfulness
of herself in the fresh and budding life of a
child of sixteen, was equal to that which she
felt for Napraxine finding solace for her own
indifference in the purchasable charms of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles petites</i>; the one seemed as trivial to her
as the other. When men spoke of their
devotion, they only meant their own passions;
if these were denied, they sought refuge in mere
physical pleasures, which at all events partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
consoled them. She thought of him with increasing
intolerance. She answered only by
monosyllables to the remarks of her companions,
and her mind wandered away to that stately
place where life might well seem a love-lay of
the Renaissance.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He will soon be tired,&rsquo; she mused, with
cruel wisdom. &lsquo;In a week the child will have
become a romance read through; a peach with
its bloom rubbed off; a poor little bird which
has only one note, and has sung that one till
its master is ready to wring its throat. It is
always so. I never see a baby run through
the fields gathering daisies and throwing them
down but what I think of men with their loves.
The only passion that lasts with them is one
which is denied, and even that is a poor affair.
To be sure, sometimes they kill themselves, but
that is rather out of rage than out of any higher
despair. And for one who kills himself for us
there are a hundred who kill themselves for
their debts. Othmar never can have any debts,
so he invents woes for himself, and captivity
for himself, and he will die of neither.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yet, contemptuous of him for what seemed
to her his weakness and his unreason as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
was, her thoughts attached themselves persistently
to him. He was the only living being
who had never wearied her, who had always
perforce interested her, who had seemed to
her unlike the rest of the world, and capable
of a master-passion, which might have risen
beyond mediocrity. How would it have been
with them if he had stood in the stead of Napraxine,
whilst she was vaguely open to dim
and noble ideals, to spiritual emotions, to human
affections?</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;It would have
been just the same thing. Love is gross and
absurd in its intimacies; it is like the hero to
his valet. Maternity is first a malady, and then
an ennui; that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">biche blanche</i> at Amyôt will
learn that as I learned it. He would have
been much more poetic than Platon, and much
more agreeable; but I dare say he would have
been much more exacting, and much more
jealous.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yet the remembrance of Amyôt pursued her,
and made her restless; with her lips she had
ridiculed the idea of nuptial joys enshrouded
in the wet woods and falling mists of the
Orleannais; but in her heart she did not laugh;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
almost&mdash;almost&mdash;she envied that child, with
the innocent, serious eyes, whom she called contemptuously
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la biche blanche</i>, who was learning
the language of love in the earliest dawn of
womanhood.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only he does not love her!&rsquo; she reflected,
with pity, disdain, and satisfaction, all commingled.
No! He loved herself. She believed
in few things, and in few emotions; but
she believed that so long as Othmar lived he
would love her alone.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quand on tient la dragée haute!</i>&rsquo; she
thought, with her unkindest smile at the
fractiousness and ingratitude of men, as she
descended at the doors of La Jacquemerille,
and with displeasure heard her servants say,
&lsquo;M. le Comte Seliedoff awaits Madame la
Princesse.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
</div>


<p>Boris Fedorovich Seliedoff was a young
cousin of Napraxine&rsquo;s; he was twenty-two years
old, tall and well made, with a beautiful face
on his broad shoulders, a face given him by a
Georgian mother. He had been an imperial
page, and was now a lieutenant in the Imperial
Guard. He was an only son, and his father
was dead; he had a great position, and was
much indulged by all his world, and was as
headstrong and as affectionate as a child.
Nadine Napraxine alone did not indulge him,
and he adored her with all the blind ecstasies
of a first love; he had obtained his leave of
absence only that he might follow her southward.
He was extremely timid in his devotion,
but he was impassioned also; the moral
question of his love for his cousin&rsquo;s wife weighed
no more with him than it weighed with Othmar.
His world was not given to consideration of
such scruples. As far as she could be enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>tained
by such stale things, she was amused by
the worship of this boy. In Russia he had
done the maddest follies at her whim and
word; once he had come from Petersburg to
the Krimea only to be able to dance one valse
with her at a ball at her villa on the Black
Sea; he had ridden his horse up the staircase
of her house in Petersburg, and taken an incredible
leap over a river in Orel, because she
wished for a stalk of foxglove growing on the
other bank; he had risked life and limb, position
and honour, again and again, to attract
her attention or to go where she was, and she
had smiled on him the more kindly the more
headstrong were his acts and the more perilous
his follies.</p>

<p>Once Napraxine had dared to say to her:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Could you not spare Boris? He is only
a lad, and his mother trusts to me to keep him
out of harm.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had answered in her chilliest tones:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pray keep him so. I do not think, however,
that you give him the best of examples.
Your clubs, your play, your various distractions,
are not all of them virtuous?&rsquo;</p>

<p>And he had been dumb, afraid to offend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
her more, though he was vaguely uneasy for
his young cousin. The lad was terribly in
earnest, and she only saw in him a young lion-whelp
whose juvenile ardours and furies were
half grotesque, half amusing. Napraxine knew
that if the lion-whelp went too far, or if she
tired of his rage and fret, she would strike him
with a whip like any other cur. But he dared
not remonstrate more; and Boris Seliedoff, on
a brief term of leave, had followed them to the
sea-shores of the south-west, and was fretting
his soul in futile rage before the indifference
of his idol and the presence of her other lovers.
It would have been very easy at the onset to
have checked the growth of this boyish passion,
but she had diverted herself with it, permitted
its exaggerations, smiled at its escapades,
fanned its fires as she so well knew how to do,
and it had sprung to a giant growth in giant
strength. This day, when she drove homeward
from the breakfast at Ezarhédine&rsquo;s, he
was waiting for her at La Jacquemerille. For
anyone to wait for her was a thing she detested;
it was a disobedience to all those unspoken
laws which she required her courtiers
implicitly to obey. She expected everyone, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
whichever sex, of whatever rank, in however
high a degree of favour, to be the humble
suer of her commands, the meek attendant
of her pleasure. To be waited for without
her desires being previously ascertained, made
her instantly in a chill and irritable mood; it
was a presumption. This morning she was
especially ready to be irritated. When she
saw the tall figure of the young soldier pacing
to and fro, with feverish steps, the marble
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perron</i> of her villa, she grew suddenly and disproportionately
angry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The boy becomes audacious,&mdash;intolerable,&mdash;impertinent,&rsquo;
she thought. &lsquo;I should have
taken him to Ezarhédine&rsquo;s if I had wanted him.
He has had too much sugar, he needs the whip.&rsquo;</p>

<p>All that was most cruel, most intolerant,
most tyrannical in her, came with a cold hard
look upon her delicate features; the temper of
those of her people who had thrust their swords
into the body of Paul began to awake in her.
She was in the humour to hurt something, the
first thing she saw; her eyes were full of scorn
and of command as they looked haughtily at
Seliedoff, and arrested him by a glance as he
sprang towards her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Who told you that I sent for you?&rsquo; she
said, with that chill contemptuous gaze which
froze the boy and magnetised him in the same
moment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No one,&rsquo; he said piteously; &lsquo;I thought,&mdash;I
imagined&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You imagined you were always welcome!&rsquo;
she replied. &lsquo;A very erroneous imagination.
You may be so to Prince Napraxine, you are
his cousin; but as the house is mine, I shall
prefer that you shall await my invitation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She spoke slightingly, and with a coldness
like the New Year ice of Russia.</p>

<p>Boris Seliedoff stood and gazed at her helplessly,
fascinated by the anger of the gaze
which swept over him in such supreme contempt.
He had before offended, before had
seen what her caprices and her unkindness
could become when she was displeased; but
all those previous moments had been as
summer showers compared with this glacial
censure which froze all his hot young blood.
So often she had been content to see him; so
often she had laughed at him with indulgence
and benignity; so often she had called him
&lsquo; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau cousin</i>,&lsquo; &rsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cher enfant</i>,&rsquo; and smiled at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
haste and eagerness when he had done much
more than this. Might not any stranger
have waited to see her pass, to hear her
speak?</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine, with that one comprehensive
disdainful glance, passed across the
marble floor, and entered through the open
glass doors of the house. She said nothing
more. The young Seliedoff, who had grown
first very red, then very pale, followed her
timidly like a chidden hound, and paused upon
the threshold, hesitating; he scarcely ventured
to enter also without some sign from her. But
she gave him none. She passed on through the
salons, and ascended the low broad staircase
without bestowing on him a single glance.
Then he knew that she was gone to her own
apartments, where no man living dared follow
her. Boris Seliedoff stole into a little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i>
humbly, and threw himself down on the first
seat he saw. He covered his face with his
hands; there were tears in his eyes, which fell
slowly through his clasped fingers.</p>

<p>He was a young dare-devil who had eaten
fire and played with death, and had hewed
down men and women and children without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
mercy by Skobeleff&rsquo;s side; but he was a mere
frightened, timid, wretched lad beneath the
lash of her displeasure. He would have crawled
for her pardon like her spaniel, even whilst he
groped about in bewilderment and darkness to
discover his own offence, and could not tell
what it had been. An older man would have
told him that it had only been the supreme
fault of arriving at the wrong moment.</p>

<p>How long he sat there he never knew; he
waited in the vague hope of a gentler word, a
more kind dismissal, at least for permission
to return. He did not remember that he
would only increase his offence, prolong his
error. The bright day was shining without on
all the gay array of shining marbles, many-coloured
azaleas, dancing waves, white sails,
blue skies; within, the shaded light fell subdued
and roseate on the porcelains, the tapestries,
the bronzes, the stands and bowls of
flowers, all the fantastic details of modern
luxury. He might have been in a peasant&rsquo;s
<i lang="ru" xml:lang="ru">isba</i> in the midst of a frozen plain for aught he
knew. Two or three clocks chimed five, and
the carillon in the stable-tower of La Jacquemerille
answered them; for anything he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
tell, he might have been there a whole day or
only fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>Whilst it was still quite daylight, servants
came in and brought lamps with rose-coloured
shades and set them down noiselessly and
went away. Seliedoff raised his head, but he
did not leave his place; he sat like a figure of
stone. He heard a sound of voices and of
laughter; through the parted curtains of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portières</i> he saw the vista of the three drawing-rooms
which opened out of the small one in
which he was. People were coming in and
standing about conversing with one another in
the rose-hued light of the lamps, lit whilst the
sun was still shining. He then remembered
that it was Thursday, her day, on which, from
five to seven, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dessus du panier</i> could come
there and idle and flirt and sip caravan tea, or
syrups or liqueurs, and have the honour of a
word from her, perhaps even of a word of
welcome. As he looked and remembered, she
herself entered the little room in which he sat,
and which was the nearest to her own apartments.
She cast a glance upon him, severe,
astonished, then passed through to the larger
salons. She wore a pale-mauve-coloured velvet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
gown, with a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jabot</i> of old point lace, and the
same lace peeping here and there from the
folds of its skirts; she had some natural yellow
roses at her throat; she had her hair <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l&rsquo;empire</i>;
she had never looked lovelier, colder, more
utterly beyond the imitation of other women
or the solicitations of men. He watched her
receive the little crowd of people already there,
and those who came after them; he heard her
sweet chill voice, now and then her laugh; he
saw all the men whom he hated gathered
about her; and the murmur of the voices, the
whispers of the discreet mirth, the scent of the
flower-laden air, the rosy gleams of the lamplight,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">frou-frou</i> of the dresses, the tinkle of
the tea-cups, came to his ear as the sounds of
the outer world come to a sick man in fever.</p>

<p>Geraldine was not there. She had always
prohibited his appearance more than once a
month at her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jour</i>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will have no one seen in my rooms as
regularly and certainly as Paul,&rsquo; she had always
said to him. Paul was her groom of the
chambers. &lsquo;Whenever any man is seen perpetually
anywhere, as immovably as though he
were a clock or a bracket, he becomes ridi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>culous;
and the woman who allows him to be
there, still more so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Geraldine had been forced to obey, with
whatever reluctance; usually he had consoled
himself, as well as he could, with the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tripot</i>.
A man is not often jealous of a day in which
he knows there exists for him, in his absence,
that safety which lies in numbers.</p>

<p>Boris Seliedoif sat on where he was with
dogged persistence, his eyes riveted on those
pretty salons in which the comedy of society
was being acted, and where he perceived nothing
save that one form, when it came
within his sight, with the grace of movement,
the charm of attitude, which were especial
to Nadine Napraxine. He thought the
coming and going of her many guests would
never end; that the buzz of the many voices
would never cease. Once or twice men
and women whom he knew came into the
little room, and sat down there for a few
moments; then he was forced to rise and
speak to them, to say he knew not what. But
he took his seat again immediately, and resumed
his silent vigil. Some of them looked
at him in surprise, for his expression was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
strange, and his black Georgian eyes were
misty yet fierce; but he was not conscious of
the notice he excited, he was only conscious
that she never glanced towards him, never
summoned him, once.</p>

<p>The two hours seemed to him endless.
When seven had struck, the last carriage rolled
away from before the windows, the last lingering
visitor, the Duc de Prangins&mdash;he who had
killed young d&rsquo;Ivrea&mdash;made his profound bow
over her hand, and took himself and his elegant
witticisms and his admirable manners back to
the Hotel de Paris at Monte Carlo. When the
doors had closed on him, Nadine Napraxine
stood a moment alone in the centre of her
salon; then swiftly turned, and came towards
Seliedoff. He rose, and awaited her sullenly.</p>

<p>Her right hand was clenched as though it
grasped the handle of a knout, and was about
to use it; a terrible anger shone from the
lustre of her eyes; her lips were pale with the
force of her displeasure.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How dare you! how dare you!&rsquo; she said
between her teeth.</p>

<p>So might an empress have spoken to a
moujik.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>To have waited unbidden in her room,
seen by all the world, sulking there as though
he were a lover once favoured, now dispossessed;
making of himself a spectacle, a ridicule,
a theme for the comment and chatter of
society&mdash;it seemed to her such intolerable presumption,
such infinite insolence, that she
could have struck him with her clenched hand
if her dignity had not forbade her. For all
her world to see this love-sick boy half-hidden
in an inner room, as though by her welcome
and authority! She, who had dismissed kings
as others dismiss lackeys when she had found
them too presuming, could find no chastisement
vast enough for such a sin against her
authority and her repute.</p>

<p>Seliedoff was but a spoilt child; he had
had his own will and way unchecked all his
short life, and all his companions and servants
had existed only for his pleasure. A foolish
and doting mother had never bridled his wishes
or tamed his passions. Before Nadine Napraxine
alone had the arrogant young noble
become submissive, suppliant, and humble.
Now, in his torture and his sense of wrong,
the natural self-will and fury of a spoilt child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
crossed, of an adoring youth checked and repudiated,
broke away from the bonds of fear
in which she had always held them. He
answered her with a torrent of words, unconsidered
and unwise, beyond all pardon.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have treated me like a dog!&rsquo; he said
in conclusion, his voice choked in his throat,
the veins of his forehead injected. &lsquo;You have
caressed me, called me, allowed me every
liberty, been pleased with my every folly; and
now you turn me out of your house as you
would turn the dog if he misbehaved himself.
But I am not a dog, I am a man, and that you
shall know, by God&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>He came nearer to her, his eyes red and
covetous, his boyish face inflamed with fiercest
passion, his arms flung out to seize her.</p>

<p>She looked at him, such a look as she
would have given to a madman to control,
and awe him; he paused, trembled, dared not
draw nearer to her.</p>

<p>She was deeply, implacably offended by
what had passed. For him to permit himself
such language and such actions, seemed to
her as intolerable an insult as if the African
boy in her service had dared to disobey her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
It was the first time that anyone had ever
ventured to insult her; it irritated all her
delicacy, infuriated all her pride. She never
paused to think what provocation she had
given; she would have struck him dead with
a glance had she been able.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are unwell, and delirious,&rsquo; she said in
her serenest, chillest tones. &lsquo;You know neither
what you do or say. I have been kind to you,
and you have presumed to misinterpret my
kindness. Your cousin would treat you like
a hound, if he knew. But you are ill, so there
is excuse for you. Go home, and I will send
you my physicians.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then she rang; and when a servant entered
from the antechamber she turned to
him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;M. le Comte Seliedoff desires his carriage.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy looked at her with a terrible look
in his eyes&mdash;pitiful, baffled, imploring, delirious.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nadine, Nadine,&rsquo; he whispered hoarsely,
&lsquo;will you send me away like that&mdash;to die?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But she had passed, with her slow soft
grace, into the adjoining room. He heard her
say to Melville, who had been asked there:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;You are after my hours, Monsignore, but
you are always welcome.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Seliedoff, with a mist like blood before his
eyes, staggered out of the little salon into the
mild primrose-scented evening air, hearing, as
in a dream, the voices of the servants who told
him that his horses waited.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She will never forgive; she will never
forgive,&rsquo; he thought, with a sickening sense
that this one moment of insanity had severed
him for ever from the woman he worshipped.
&lsquo;She will never forgive; I shall never enter
her house again!&rsquo;</p>

<p>All the lovely scene stretching before him
in its peace and luxuriance, as the stars came
out in the deep blue skies and the daylight
still lingered upon shore and sea, was blotted
out for him by a red haze as of blood and of
tears.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
</div>


<p>Meanwhile Melville, who had come to take
his leave before proceeding to Paris under
orders from the Vatican, found his hostess
evidently <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyée</i>; she was not in her usual
serene humour.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What has irritated you, Princess?&rsquo; that
very observant person presumed at last to ask.
&lsquo;Have you actually discovered that doubled
rose-leaf of whose existence you have been
always sure and I always sceptical?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The doubled rose-leaf is that enormous
nuisance, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la bêtise humaine</i>,&rsquo; she replied with
ennui, breaking off some blossoms of an
odontoglossum standing near her. &lsquo;It is like
the fog in London, it penetrates everywhere,
you cannot escape it; there has been no rose-glass
made which could shut it out. If Balzac
had written for centuries, he would never have
come to an end of it. Do you ever find any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
variety in your confessional? I never do in
my drawing-rooms.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And yet who should find it, if not Madame
Napraxine?&rsquo; said Melville, who, when in his
worldly moods, did not especially care to be
reminded that he was a churchman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not know who should,&mdash;I know that I
never do,&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;I have made <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la chasse
au caractère</i> ever since I was old enough to
know what character meant; and my only
wonder is how, out of such a sameness of
material, St.-Simon and La Bruyère and Ste.-Beuve,
and all those people who write so well,
ever were able to make such entertaining
books. I suppose it is done by the same sort
of science which enables mathematicians to
make endless permutations out of four numbers.
For myself, I should like other numbers
than those we know by rote.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good heavens!&rsquo; thought Melville, &lsquo;when
men have died because she laughed! Is that
so very commonplace? or, is it not tragic
enough?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Aloud he said, in his courtliest manner:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Princess, I fear the sameness of human
nature tries you so greatly because of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
sameness of the emotions which you excite in
it; I can imagine that too much adoration
may cloy like too much sugar. Also, in your
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chasse au caractère</i> you have, like all who
hunt, left behind you a certain little bourgeois
quality called pity; an absurd little quality, no
doubt, still one which helps observation. I
am sure you have read Tourguenieff&rsquo;s little
story of the quail?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes; but one eats them still, you know,
just the same as if he had never written it.
Pity may be a microscope, I do not know; besides,
you must admit that a quail is a much
lovelier little life than a man&rsquo;s, and so can
excite it so much more easily. A quail is quite
a charming little bird. Myself, I never eat
birds at all; it is barbarous.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What I meant to say was,&rsquo; suggested
Melville, &lsquo;that, in that tiny tale, Tourguenieff,
like a poet, as he was, at heart, describes precisely
what sympathy will do to open the
intelligence to the closed lives of others,
whether bird or man. Perhaps, madame, sympathy
would even do something to smooth the
creases out of your rose-leaf&mdash;if you tried it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose I am not sympathetic,&rsquo; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Nadine Napraxine, stripping the petals of the
odontoglossum; &lsquo;they all say so. But I think
it is their own fault; they are so uninteresting.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The quail,&rsquo; said Melville, &lsquo;to almost
everybody is only a little juicy morsel to be
wrapped in a vine-leaf and roasted; but Tourguenieff
had the vision to see in it the courage
of devotion, the heroism of maternity, the loveliness
of its life, the infinite pathos of its death.
Yet, the exceptional estimate of the student&rsquo;s
view of it was quite as true as the general
view of the epicure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Am I an epicure?&rsquo; said Nadine Napraxine,
amused.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Spiritually, intellectually, you are,&rsquo; replied
Melville; &lsquo;and so nothing escapes the fastidiousness
of your taste; yet perhaps, madame,
something may escape the incompleteness of
your sympathies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is very possible; but, as I observed
to Lady Brancepeth when she made me a
similar reproach, one is as one is made. One
is Tourguenieff or one is Brillat-Savarin, all
that is arranged beforehand for one&mdash;somewhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Melville had learned the ways of the world
too well not to know how to glide easily, with
closed eyes and averted ears, over such irreverences;
but he ventured to say:</p>

<p>&lsquo;One cannot dispute the fact of natural
idiosyncrasy and inclination, of course; but
may not one&rsquo;s self-culture be as much of the
character as of the mind? Might it not become
as interesting to strive and expand one&rsquo;s
moral as one&rsquo;s intellectual horizon? It seems
so to me, at the least.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She laughed, and rang a little silver bell
for Mahmoud to bring them some fresh tea.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Monsignore,&rsquo; she said, with
amusement and admiration; &lsquo;for enwrapping
a kernel of religious advice in an envelope
of agreeable social conversation, there is not
your equal anywhere&mdash;you may well be beloved
of the Propaganda! But, alas! it is all
wasted on me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Melville reddened a little with irritation:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I understand,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;I fear,
Princess, that you are like Virschow or Paul
Bert, who are so absorbed in cutting, burning,
and electrifying the nerves of dogs that the
dog, as a sentient creature, a companion, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
friend, is wholly unknown to them. Humanity,
poor Humanity, is your dog.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will you have some tea?&rsquo; she said, as
Mahmoud brought in her service made by
goldsmiths of the Deccan, who sat on mats
under their banana trees, with the green
parrots flying over the aloes and the euphorbia,
and who produced work beside which all the
best which Europe can do with her overgrown
workshops is clumsy, inane, and vulgar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What you suggested was very pretty,&rsquo;
she continued, pouring out the clear golden
stream on the slices of lemon; &lsquo;and I had
no right to laugh at you for wrapping up a
sermon in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nougat</i>. Of course the character
ought to be trained and developed just like the
body and the mind, only nobody thinks so; no
education is conducted on those lines. And
so, though we overstrain the second, and pamper
the third, we wholly neglect the first. I
imagine that it never occurs to anyone out of
the schoolroom to restrain a bad impulse or
uproot a bad quality. Why should it? We
are all too busy in trying to be amused, and
failing. Do you not think it was always so in
the world? Do you suppose La Bruyère, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
instance, ever turned his microscope on himself?
And do you think, if he had done, that
any amount of self-scrutiny would have made
La Bruyère Pascal or Vincent de Paul?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; but it might have made him comprehend
them, or their likenesses. I did not
mean to moralise, madame; I merely meant
that the issue of self-analysis is sympathy,
whilst the issue of the anatomy of other organisations
is cruelty even where it may be
wisdom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That may be true in general, and I daresay
is so; but the exception proves the rule,
and I am the exception. Whenever I do think
about myself I only arrive at two conclusions;
the one, that I am not as well amused as I
ought to be considering the means I have at
my disposal, and the other is that, if I were
quite sure that anything would amuse me very
much, I should sacrifice everything else to
enjoy it. Neither of those results is objective
in its sympathies; and you would not, I
suppose, call either of them moral.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I certainly should not,&rsquo; said Melville, &lsquo;except
that there is always a certain amount of
moral health in any kind of perfect frankness.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;I am always perfectly frank,&rsquo; said the
Princess Nadine; &lsquo;so is Bismarck. But the
world has made up its mind that we are both
of us always feigning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is the world&rsquo;s revenge for being
ruled by each of you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is it permitted in these serious days for
churchmen to make pretty speeches? I prefer
your scoldings, they are more uncommon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The kindness which permits them is uncommon,&rsquo;
said Melville, as he took up his tea-cup.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! I can be kind,&rsquo; said Nadine Napraxine.
&lsquo; Ask Mahmoud and my little dog.
But then Mahmoud is dumb, and the dog is&mdash;a
dog. If humanity were my dog, too, as you
say, I should make it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aphone</i>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor humanity!&rsquo; said Melville, with a
sigh. &lsquo;If it would not offend you, Princess,
there are two lines of Mürger which always
seem to me to exactly describe the attitude, or
rather the altitude, from which you regard all
our sorrows and follies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And they are?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They are those in which he thinks he
hears:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">&ldquo;Le fifre au son aigu railler le violoncelle,</div>
    <div class="verse">Qui pleure sous l&rsquo;archet ses notes de crystal;&rdquo;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>only we must substitute for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aigu</i> some prettier
word, say <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">perlé</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She laughed, thinking of Boris Seliedoff,
with more perception of his absurdities than of
his offences, as her first movement of wrath
subsided into that ironical serenity which was
most natural to her of all her varying
moods.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The violoncello does not know itself why
it weeps,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;so why should the fife
not laugh at it? Really, if I were not so impious
a being, I would join your Church for
the mere pleasure of confessing to you; you
have such fine penetration, such delicate suggestion.
But then, there is no living being
who understands women as a Catholic priest
does who is also a man of the world. Adieu!
or rather, I hope, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</i>. You are going
away for Lent? Ours will soon be here. I
shock every Russian because I pay no heed to
its sanctity. Did you ever find, even amongst
your people, any creatures so superstitious in
their religion as Russians? Platon is certainly
the least moral man the sun shines on, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
would not violate a fast nor neglect a rite to
save his life. It is too funny! Myself, I have
fish from the Baltic and soups (very nasty
ones) from Petersburg, and deem that quite
concession enough to Carême. My dear Monsignore,
why <em>should</em> there be salvation in
salmon and sin in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salmis</i>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Melville was not at all willing to enter on
that grave and large question with so incorrigible
a mocker. He took his leave, and
bowed himself out from her presence; whilst
Nadine Napraxine went to her own rooms to
dress for dinner and look at the domino which
she would wear some hours later at a masked
ball which was to take place that night in her
own house in celebration of the last evening of
the Catholic Carnival.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

    <p>&lsquo;Le masque est si charmant que j&rsquo;ai peur du visage,&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>she murmured inconsequently, as she glanced
at the elegant disguise and the Venetian
costume to be worn beneath it which had
been provided for her. &lsquo;That is the sort of
feeling which one likes to inspire, and which
one also prefers to feel. Always the mask,
smiling, mysterious, unintelligible, seductive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
suggestive of all kinds of unrealised, and therefore
of unexhausted pleasures; never the face
beneath it, the face which frowns and weeps
and shows everything, is unlovely, only just
because it is known and must in due time even
grow wrinkled and yellow. How agreeable
the world would be if no one ever took off
their masks or their gloves!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
</div>


<p>On the following day as she returned from her
drive, she was met, to her great surprise, by
Napraxine, who descended the steps of the
house with a face unusually pale, and a manner
unusually grave.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What can possibly be the matter, Platon?&rsquo;
she said, with a vague sense of alarm, but with
her inevitable mockery of him dominating her
transient anxiety. &lsquo;Have you had a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culotte</i>
yonder? Has Athenais gone away with my
jewel-safe? Or have our friends the Nihilists
fired Zaraizoff?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Napraxine gave her his hand to help her
to alight.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not jest,&rsquo; he said simply. &lsquo;Boris has
shot himself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Boris?&mdash;Boris Fédorovitch?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She spoke in astonishment and anger rather
than sorrow: an impatient frown contracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
her delicate brows, though she grew ashen
pale. Why would men do these things?</p>

<p>Napraxine was silent, but when they had
entered the house he spoke very sadly, almost
sternly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This afternoon he had lost a hundred
thousand francs; no doubt on purpose to have
an excuse. The ruse can deceive nobody. A
Count Seliedoff could lose as much all day
for a year, and make no sign. He shot himself
in the gardens, within a few yards of us
all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He paused and looked at his wife. A
shadow passed over her face without changing
its narcissus-like fairness; she shrugged her
shoulders ever so slightly, her eyes had had for
a moment an expression of awe and regret,
but, beyond any other sentiment with her, were
her impatience and irritation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why will men be so stupid?&rsquo; she thought.
&lsquo;As if it did any good! The foolish boy!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nadine,&rsquo; murmured her husband in a
voice that was timid even in its expostulation
and reproach. &lsquo;I am sorry for Boris; for the
other I have never cared, but for Boris;&mdash;you
know that I promised his mother to take what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
care I could of him&mdash;and now&mdash;and now&mdash;and
so young as he was!&mdash;and how shall I tell
her?&mdash;My God!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She was silent; a genuine pain was on
her face, though still mingled with the more
personal emotion of impatience and annoyance.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was no fault of yours!&rsquo; she said at last,
as she saw two great tears roll down her husband&rsquo;s
cheeks.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, it was,&rsquo; muttered Platon Napraxine.
&lsquo;I let him know you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The direct accusation banished the softer
pain which had for the minute moved her; she
was at all times intolerant of censure or of
what she resented as a too intimate interference;
and here her own surprise at an unlooked-for
tragedy, and her own self-consciousness of
having been more or less the cause and
creatress of it, stung her with an unwelcome
and intolerable truth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are insolent,&rsquo; she said, with the regard
which always daunted Napraxine, and
made him feel himself an offender against her,
even when he was entirely in the right.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are insolent,&rsquo; she repeated. &lsquo;Do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
mean to insinuate that I am responsible for
Seliedoff&rsquo;s suicide? One would suppose you
were a journalist seeking <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chantage</i>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The power which she at all times possessed
over her husband making him unwilling to
irritate, afraid to offend her, and without courage
before her slightest sign of anger, rendered
him timid now. He hesitated and grew pale,
but the great sorrow and repentance which were
at work in him gave him more resolution than
usual; he was very pale, and the tears rolled
down his cheeks unchecked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Every one knows that Boris loved you,&rsquo; he
said simply. &lsquo;All the world knows that; he was
a boy, he could not conceal it; I cannot tell
what you did to him, but something which broke
his heart. You know I never say anything;
you give me no title. I am as much of a
stranger to you as if we had met yesterday;
and do not fancy I am ever&mdash;jealous&mdash;as men
are sometimes. I know you would laugh at
me, and besides, you care for none of them any
more than you care for me. I should be a fool
to wish for more than that;&mdash;if it be always
like that, I shall never say anything. Only you
might have spared this lad. He was so young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and my cousin, and the only one left to his
mother.&lsquo;</p>

<p>He paused, in stronger agitation than he
cared to allow her to see. It was the first time
for years that he had ventured to speak to her
in any sort of earnestness or of upbraiding.
She had allotted him his share in her life, a
very distant one; and he had accepted it without
dispute or lament, if not without inward
revolt; it was for the first time for years
that he presumed to show her he had observed
her actions and had disapproved them,
to hint that he was not the mere lay figure, the
mere good-natured dolt, &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon comme du pain</i>,&rsquo;
and as commonplace, which she had always
considered him.</p>

<p>She looked at him a little curiously; there
was a dangerous irritation in her glance, yet a
touch of emotion was visible in her as she said
with impatience, &lsquo;You are growing theatrical.
It does not become you. Boris was a boy,
foolish as boys are; he had no mind; he
was a mere spoilt child; he was grown up
in inches, not in character; so many Russians
are. If he have killed himself, who can help
it? They should have kept him at home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Why do you play yourself? He is not the
first.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, he is not the first,&rsquo; said Napraxine,
with a curt bitterness. &lsquo;He is not the first,
and it was not play; he only played to have
an excuse. He thought of your name, perhaps
of mine; he did not wish the world to know
he died because you laughed at him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Laughed! I used to laugh; why not?
He was amusing before he grew tragical. I
rebuked him yesterday, for he deserved it.
Everyone scolds boys. It is good for them.
No one supposes&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; her tone was impatient
and contemptuous, but her lips quivered a
little; she was sorry that the boy was dead,
though she would not say so. It hurt her,
though it annoyed her more.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did he&mdash;did he suffer?&rsquo; she asked, abruptly.</p>

<p>Napraxine took out of the breast-pocket
of his coat a sheet of note-paper, and gave it
her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He died instantly, if you mean that,&rsquo; he
answered. &lsquo;He knew enough to aim well.
They brought me that note; he had written it
last night, I think.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>In the broad, rude handwriting of the
young Seliedoff there was written:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pardonnez-moi, mon cousin: je l&rsquo;adore, et
elle se moque de moi; je ne peux pas vivre,
mais j&rsquo;aurai soin que le monde n&rsquo;en sache rien.
Soignez ma pauvre mère. Tout à vous de
c&oelig;ur</p>

<p>
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Boris Fédorovitch</span>.&rsquo; <br />
</p>

<p>She read it with a mist before her eyes, and
gave it back to him without a word.</p>

<p>Napraxine looked at her wistfully; he wondered
if he had killed himself whether she
would have cared more than she cared now&mdash;no,
he knew she would have cared as little,
even less.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You say nothing?&rsquo; he murmured wistfully.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is there to say?&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;It
was a boy&rsquo;s blunder. It was a grievous folly.
But no one could foresee it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is all the lament you give him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Would it please you better if I were weeping
over his corpse? I regret his death profoundly;
but I confess that I am also unspeakably
annoyed at it. I detest melodramas.
I detest tragedies. The world will say, as you
have the good taste to say, that I have been at
fault. I am not a coquette, and a reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
of being one gives me no satisfaction. As you
justly observed, no one will believe that a
Count Seliedoff destroyed his life because he
lost money at play. Therefore, they will say,
as you have been so good as to say, that the
blame lies with me. And such accusations
offend me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She spoke very quietly, but with a tone
which seemed chill as the winter winds of
the White Sea, to Napraxine, whose soul was
filled with remorse, dismay, and bewildered
pain. Then she made him a slight gesture of
farewell and left him. As usual, he was entirely
right in the reproaches he had made, yet
she had had the power to make himself feel
at once foolish and at fault, at once coarse and
theatrical.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Boris!&rsquo; he muttered, as he drew his
hand across his wet lashes.</p>

<p>Had it been worth while to die at three-and-twenty
years old, in full command of all
which the world envies, only to have that cruel
sacrifice called a boy&rsquo;s blunder? His heart
ached and his thoughts went, he knew not
why, to his two young children away in the
birch forests by the Baltic Sea. She would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
care any more if she heard on the morrow that
they were as dead in their infancy as Boris
Seliedoff was in his youth, lying under the
aloes and the palms of Monte Carlo in the
southern sunshine.</p>

<p>Platon Napraxine was a stupid man, a man
not very sensitive or very tender of feeling, a
man who could often console himself with
coarse pleasures and purchasable charms for
wounds given to his affections or his pride;
but he was a man of quick compunction and
warm emotions; he felt before the indifference
of his wife as though he stretched out his hand
to touch a wall of ice, when what he longed
for was the sympathetic answering clasp of
human fingers. He brushed the unusual moisture
from his eyes, and went to fulfil all those
innumerable small observances which so environ,
embitter, and diminish the dignity of
death to the friends of every dead creature.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nadine passed on to her own
rooms, and let her waiting-woman change her
clothes.</p>

<p>A momentary wish, wicked as a venomous
snake, and swift as fire, had darted through her
thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Why had not Othmar died like that?
I would have loved his memory all my life!&rsquo;
she thought, with inconsistency.</p>

<p>Though she had almost refused to acknowledge
it, the suicide of Seliedoff pained and
saddened her. Foremost of all was her irritation
that she who disliked tragedies, who
abhorred publicity, who disbelieved in passion,
should be thus subject to having her name in
the mouths of men in connection with a melodrama
which, terrible as it was, yet offended
her by its vulgarity and its stupidity. The hour
and the scene chosen were vulgar; the transparency
of the pretext was stupid. It was
altogether, as she had said, a boy&rsquo;s blunder&mdash;a
blunder, frightful, irreparable, with the horror
of youth misspent and life self-destroyed upon
it&mdash;still a blunder. She thought, with impatience,
that what they called love was only a
spoilt child&rsquo;s whim and passionate outcry which,
denied, ended in a child&rsquo;s wild, foolish fit of rage,
with no more wisdom in it than the child has.</p>

<p>All Europe would say that, indirectly, she
had been the cause of his death; every one
had seen him, moping and miserable, in her
rooms the previous day. She disliked a sensa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>tional
triumph, which was fit for her husband&rsquo;s
mistresses, for Lia, for Aurélie, for la belle
Fernande. Men were always doing these
foolish things for her. She had been angry
certainly: who would not have been so? He
had been ridiculous, as youth and intense
emotion and unreasonable suffering constantly
are in the sight of others.</p>

<p>There had been only one man who had not
seemed to her absurd when passion had moved
him, and that had only been because he had
remained master of himself even in his greatest
self-abandonment. If it had been Othmar who
had been lying dead there with the bullet in
his breast, she would have felt&mdash;she was not
sure what she would have felt&mdash;some pleasure,
some pain. Instead, he was at Amyôt finding
what pleasures he might in a virginal love, like
a spring snowdrop, timid and afraid. She, who
always analysed her own soul without indulgence
or self-delusion, was disgusted at the
impulses which moved her now.</p>

<p>&lsquo;After all,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;Goethe was right;
we are always capable of crime, even the best
of us; only one must be Goethe to be capable
of acknowledging that.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>She sat alone awhile, thoughtful and regretful;
indisposed to accept the blame of
others, yet not unwilling to censure herself if
she saw cause. But she saw no cause here;
it was no fault of hers if men loved her as she
passed by them without seeing they were there.
True, she had been annoyed with the youth;
she had been irritated by him; she had treated
him a little as some women treat a dog,&mdash;a
smile one day, the whip the next; but she had
thought so little about him all the time, except
that his high spirits were infectious and his face
was boyishly beautiful, and that it had diverted
her to annoy Geraldine. But who could have
supposed that it would end thus? And amidst
her pain and her astonishment was foremost
a great irritation at his want of thought for
her.</p>

<p>The journals, with their innuendoes, their
initials, their transparent mysteries; the condolences
and the curiosities of her own society; the
reproaches of his family; the long ceremonious
Russian mourning and Russian rites&mdash;&lsquo; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelle
corvée!</i>&rsquo; she murmured impatiently, as at some
pebble in her embroidered shoe, at some clove
of garlic in her delicate dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>After all, were the great sorrows of life
one-half so unendurable in themselves as the
tiresome annoyances with which the foolish
habits of men have environed them?</p>

<p>That our friend dies is pain enough, why
must we have also the nuisance of following
his funeral?</p>

<p>&lsquo;Men only think of themselves!&rsquo; she said
irritably, in her own unconscious egotism. If
Boris Seliedoff had considered her as he should
have done, he would not have killed himself
within three miles of her garden terrace, at a
moment when all their own gossiping world
was crowding on the sunny shores of the
Mediterranean. A sense of the wrong done to
herself divided the regret, tinged almost with
remorse, which weighed on her.</p>

<p>As she moved through her boudoir to write
the inevitable and most difficult letter which
must be penned to his mother far away in the
province of the Ekaterinoslaf, a photograph, in
a frame of blue plush, caught her eye as it stood
amongst all the pretty costly nothings of her
writing-table. It was a photograph of Seliedoff;
it had been tinted with an artist&rsquo;s skill, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
boyish handsome mouth smiled tenderly and
gaily at her.</p>

<p>For almost the first time in her life she felt
the tears rise to her throat and eyes. She laid
the picture face downward, and wept.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>A few days later when the remains of Boris
Seliedoff had been removed to Russia, there to
find their last home in the sombre mausoleum
of his family on their vast estates in Ekaterinoslaf,
Geraldine, who was one of the few who
were admitted to La Jacquemerille in these
days of mourning, coming thither one afternoon
to find her in the garden alone and to
entreat for permission to follow her in the
various travels which she was about to undertake,
since the Riviera had grown distasteful
to her, was accosted by her abruptly, if in her
delicate languor she could ever be termed
abrupt:</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Ralph,&rsquo; she said briefly, &lsquo;why do
you not go home?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Geraldine drew his breath quickly, and
stared at her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go home!&rsquo; he repeated stupidly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, you have a home; you have several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
homes,&rsquo; she said, with her usual impatience at
being questioned or misunderstood by wits
slower than her own. &lsquo;You are an Englishman;
you must have a million and one duties.
It is utterly wrong to live so much away from
your properties. We do it, but I do not think
it matters what we do. Whether we be here
or there, it is always the stewards who rule
everything, but in your country it is different.
Your sister says you can do a great deal of good.
I cannot imagine what good you should do,
but no doubt she knows. I do not like England
myself. Your châteaux are very fine, but the
life in them is very tiresome. You all eat far
too much and far too often, and you have
lingering superstitions about Sunday; your
women are always three months behind Paris,
and never wear shoes like their gowns; your
talk is always of games, and shooting, and flat-racing.
You are not an amusing people; you
never will be. You have too much of the
Teuton, and the Hollander, and the Dane in
you. Your stage makes one yawn, your books
make one sleep, your country-houses make one
do both. Your women clothe themselves in
Newmarket coats, get red faces, and like to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
over wet fields; your men are well built very
often, but they move ill; they have no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">désinvolture</i>,
they have no charm. The whole thing
is tiresome. I shall never willingly go to England;
but you, as a great English noble, ought
to go there, and stay there&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And marry there!&rsquo; said Geraldine, bitterly.
&lsquo;Is that the medicine you prescribe for
all your friends?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course you will marry some time,&rsquo; she
said indifferently. &lsquo;Men of your position always
do; they think they owe it to their country.
But whether you marry or not, go home and
be useful. You have idled quite too much time
away in following our changes of residence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He turned pale, and his eyes grew dark
with subdued anger.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You want to be rid of me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, that is just the kind of rough, rude
thing which an Englishman always says. It is
the reason why Englishmen do not please women
much. No Italian or Frenchman or Russian
would make such a stupid, almost brutal, remark
as that; he would respect his own dignity
and the courtesy of words too greatly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We are unpolished, even at our best; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
have told me so fifty times,&rsquo; he said sullenly.
&lsquo;Well, let me be a savage, then, and ask for a
savage mercy; a plain answer. You want me
away?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nadine&rsquo;s eyes grew very cold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never say uncivil things,&rsquo; she answered,
with an accent that was chill as the mistral.
&lsquo;But since for once you divine one&rsquo;s meaning, I
will not deny the accuracy of your divination.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She blew a little cloud from a tiny cigarette
as she paused. She expressed, as clearly as
though she had spoken, the fact that her companion
was as little to her as that puff of
smoke.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Does sincerity count for nothing?&rsquo; he
muttered stupidly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sincerity!&rsquo; she echoed. &lsquo;Ah! English
people always speak as if they had a monopoly
of sincerity, like a monopoly of salt or a
monopoly of coal! My dear Lord Geraldine,
I am not doubting your sincerity in the very
least; it is not <em>that</em> which is wanting in
you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is?&rsquo; he asked in desperation.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So much!&rsquo; said the Princess Napraxine
with a little comprehensive smile and sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;If you would deign to speak definitely&mdash;&rsquo;
he murmured in bitter pain, which he strove
clumsily to make into the likeness of serenity
and irony.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, if you wish for details!&mdash;It is just
that kind of wish for details which shows what
you fail in so very much; tact, finesse, observation,
flexibility. My dear friend, you are
thoroughly insular! Everything is comprised
in that!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have not the least wish to vex you,&rsquo; she
continued. &lsquo;I am quite sorry to vex you, but
if you will press me&mdash;&mdash;A painter teased me
the other day to go to his studio and see what
he had done for the salon. I made him polite
excuses, the weather, my health, my engagements,
the usual phrases, but he would not be
satisfied with them, he continued to insist, so
at last he had the truth. I told him that I
detested almost all modern art, and that I did
not know why anyone encouraged it at all
when it was within everyone&rsquo;s power to have
at least line-engravings of the old masters. He
was not pleased&mdash;take warning. Do not be as
stupid as he.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Geraldine understood, and his tanned cheek
grew white with pain. He was a proud man,
and had been made vain by his world. He
was bitterly and cruelly humbled, but the love
he had for her made him almost unconscious
of the offence to him, so overwhelming in its
cruelty was the sentence of exile which he
received.</p>

<p>He did not speak at once, for he could not be
sure to command his voice, and he shrank from
betraying what he felt. She rose, and threw the
cigarette over the balustrade into the sea, and
turned to go indoors. She had said what her
wishes were, and she expected to have them
obeyed without more discussion. But the young
man rose too, and barred her way.</p>

<p>He had only one consciousness, that he was
on the point of banishment from the only
woman whom he had cared for through two
whole years. It had become so integral a part
of his life that he should follow Nadine Napraxine
as the moon follows the earth, that
exile from her presence seemed to him the
most terrible of disasters, the most unendurable
of chastisements.</p>

<p>&lsquo;After all this time, do you only tell me to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
away?&rsquo; he muttered, conscious of the lameness
and impotency of his own words, which might
well only move her laughter. But a certain
anger rather than amusement was what they
stirred in her; there was in them an implied
right, an implied reproach, which were both
what she was utterly indisposed to admit his
title to use.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All this time!&rsquo; she echoed; &lsquo;all what
time? You are leading a very idle life, and
all your excellent friends say that you leave
many duties neglected; I advise you to return
to them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is it the end of all?&rsquo; he said, while his
lips trembled in his own despite.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All? All what? The end? No; it is
the end to nothing that I know of; I should
rather suppose that you would make it the
beginning&mdash;of a perfectly proper life at home.
Evelyn Brancepeth says you ought to reduce
all your farmers&rsquo; rents; go and do it; it will
make you popular in your own county. I know
you good English always fancy that you can
quench revolutions with a little weak tea of that
sort. As if people who hate you will not hate
you just the same whether they pay you half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
a guinea, or half a crown, for every sod of
ground! Our Tsar Alexander thought the
same sort of thing <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en grand</i>, and did it; but
it has not answered with him. To be sure,
he was even sillier&mdash;he expected slaves to be
grateful!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You really mean that you are tired of my
presence?&rsquo; he said, with no sense of anything
except the immense desolation which seemed
suddenly to cover all his life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You <em>will</em> put the dots on all your i&rsquo;s!&rsquo; she
said impatiently. &lsquo;That kind of love of explanation
is so English; all your political men&rsquo;s time
is wasted in it. Nobody in England understands
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à demi-mot</i>, or appreciates the prettiness
of a hint.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I understand well enough&mdash;too well,&rsquo; he
muttered, with a sigh that was choked in its
birth. &lsquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;I suppose I am a fool; I
did not think you really cared much&mdash;yet I
always fancied&mdash;I suppose I had no right&mdash;but
surely we have been friends at the least?&rsquo;</p>

<p>His knowledge of the world and of women
ought to have stopped the question unuttered;
but a great pain, an intense disappointment,
had mastered him, and left him with no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
tact or wisdom than if he had been a mere
lad fresh from college. It cost him much to
make his reproach so measured, his words so
inoffensive. He began to understand why men
had said that Nadine Napraxine was more
perilous in her chastity and her spiritual cruelty
than the most impassioned Alcina.</p>

<p>She looked at him with a little astonishment
mingled with a greater offence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Friends? certainly; why not?&rsquo; she said,
with entire indifference. &lsquo;Who is talking of
enmity? In plain words, since you like them
so much, you do&mdash;bore me just a little; you
are too often here; you have a certain manner
in society which might make gossips remark it.
You do not seem to comprehend that one may
see too much of the most agreeable person
under the sun. It is, perhaps, a mistake ever
to see much of anyone; at least, I think so.
Briefly, I do not wish to have any more stories
for Nice and its neighbourhood; this one of
Boris Seliedoff is quite enough! They are beginning
to give me a kind of reputation of
being a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tueuse d&rsquo;hommes</i>. It is so vulgar, that
kind of thing. They are beginning to call me
Marie Stuart; it is absurd, but I do not like that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
sort of absurdities. I had nothing to do with the
folly of poor Boris, but no one will ever believe
it; he will always be considered my victim.
It is true you are certain not to kill yourself;
Englishmen always kill a tiger or a pig
if they are unhappy, never themselves. I am
not afraid of your doing any kind of harm; you
will only go home and see your farmers and
please your family; and you will give big
breakfasts in uncomfortable tents, and be
toasted, and your county newspapers will have
all sorts of amiable paragraphs about you, and
sometime or other you will marry&mdash;why not?
Please stand back a little and let me pass; we
shall meet in Paris next year when you take a
holiday on your reduced rents.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She laughed a little, for the first time since
Seliedoff&rsquo;s suicide; her own words amused her.
Those poor English gentlemen, who fancied
they would stem the great salt tide of class
hatred, the ever-heaving ocean of plebeian
envy, by the little paper fence of a reduced
rental! Poor Abels, deluding themselves with
the idea that they could disarm the jealousy of
their Cains with a silver penny!</p>

<p>But the thoughts of Geraldine were far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
away from any political ironies with which
she might entertain her own discursive mind.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nadine, Nadine,&rsquo; he said stupidly, &lsquo;you
cannot be so cruel. I have always obeyed
you; I have never murmured; I have been
like your dog; I have been content on so
little. Other men would have rebelled, but
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her languid eyes opened widely upon him
in haughty surprise and rebuke.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now you talk like a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune premier</i> of
the Gymnase!&rsquo; she said, contemptuously.
&lsquo;Rebelled? Content? What words are those?
You have been a pleasant acquaintance&mdash;amongst
many. You cannot say you have
been ever more. If you have begun to misunderstand
that, go where you can recover
your good sense. I have liked you; so has
Prince Napraxine. Do not force us to consider
our esteem misplaced.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She spoke coldly, almost severely; then,
with an enchanting smile, she held out her
hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, we will part friends, though you
are disposed to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouder</i> like a boy. You know
something of the world; learn to look as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
you had learned at least its first lesson&mdash;good
temper. Affect it if you have it not! And&mdash;never
outstay a welcome!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her and his chest heaved with
a heavy sigh that was almost a sob. Passionate
upbraiding rose to his lips, a thousand
reproaches for delusive affabilities, for patiently-endured
caprices, for wasted hours and wasted
hopes, and wasted energies, all rose to his
mouth in hot hard words of senseless, irrepressible
pain; but they remained unuttered.
He dared not offend her beyond pardon, he
dared not exile himself beyond recall. He
was conscious of the futility of any reproach
which he could bring, of the absence of any
title which he could allege. For two years
he had been her bondsman, her spaniel, her
submissive servant in the full sight of the
world, yet looking backward he could not
recall any sign or word or glance which could
have justified him in the right to call himself
her lover. She had accepted his services,
permitted his presence&mdash;no more; and yet, he
felt himself as bitterly wronged, as cruelly
deluded, as ever man could have been by
woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a little song which has been given
world-wide fame by the sweetest singer of our
time: the little song which is called, &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si vous
n&rsquo;avez rien à me dire</i>.&rsquo; Just so vague, and so
intense, as is the reproach of the song, was the
cry of his heart against her now.</p>

<p>If she had never cared, had never meant,
why then&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>But he dared not formulate his injury in
words; he knew that it would condemn him never
to see her face again except in crowds as strangers
saw it. He had never really believed that she
would care for him as he cared for her, but it
had always seemed to him that habit would in
the end become affection, that the continual
and familiar intercourse which he had obtained
with her would become in time necessary to
her, an association, a custom, a friendship not
lightly to be discarded. He had believed that
patience would do more for him than passion;
he had endured all her caprices, followed all
her movements, incurred the ridicule of men,
and, what was worse, his own self-contempt, in
the belief that, with her, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Festina lente</i> was the
sole possible rule of victory. And now she
cast him aside, with no more thought than she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
left to her maids a fan of an old fashion, a
glove that had been worn once!</p>

<p>She gave him no time to recover the shock
with which he had heard his sentence of exile,
but, with a little kindly indifferent gesture,
passed him and went into the house.</p>

<p>He had not the courage of Othmar; he
had never had as much title as Othmar to
deem himself preferred to the multitude;
looking back on the two years which he had
consecrated to her memory and her service,
he could not honestly recall a single word or
glance or sign which could have justified him
in believing himself betrayed.</p>

<p>She had accepted his homage as she accepted
the bouquets which men sent her, to die in
masses in her ante-chambers.</p>

<p>His pain was intolerable, his disappointment
was altogether out of proportion to the frail,
vague hopes which he had cherished; but he
felt also that his position was absurd, untenable;
he had never been her lover, he had
none of the rights of a lover; he was only one
of many who had failed to please her, who had
unconsciously blundered, who had committed
the one unpardonable sin of wearying her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Resistance could only make him ridiculous
in her eyes. She had plainly intimated that
she was tired of his acquaintance and companionship.
It was an intense suffering to him,
but it was not one which he could show to the
world, or in which he could seek the world&rsquo;s
sympathy. If he had failed to please her&mdash;failed,
despite all his opportunities, to obtain
any hold upon her sympathies&mdash;it was such
a failure as is only grotesque in the esteem
of men, and contemptible in the sight of
women.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A qui la faute?</i>&rsquo; she would have said
herself, with a pitiless amusement, which the
world would only have echoed.</p>

<p>It was late in February, but already spring
in the Riviera; a brilliant sun was dancing
on all the million and one pretty things in her
boudoir, for she liked light, and could afford,
with her exquisite complexion and her flower-like
mouth, to laugh at the many less fortunate
of her sex, who dared not be seen without
all the devices of red glass and rose-coloured
transparencies and muffled sunbeams. She
caressed her little dog, and bade the negro boy
bring her some tea, and stretched herself out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
on a long low chair with a pleasant sense
of freedom from a disagreeable duty done and
over.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will never be intimate with an Englishman
again,&rsquo; she thought. &lsquo;They cannot understand;
they think they must be either your
Cæsar or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nullus</i>: it is so stupid; and then,
when you are tired, they grumble. Other men
say nothing to you, but they fight somebody
else,&mdash;which is so much better. It is only the
Englishman who grumbles, and abuses you as
if you were the weather!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The idea amused her.</p>

<p>Through her open windows she could see
the sea. She saw the boat of Geraldine, with
its red-capped crew pulling straightway to the
westward; he was going to his yacht; the
affair was over peaceably; he would not kill
himself like Seliedoff. Her husband would
miss him for a little time, but he was used
to men who made themselves his ardent and
assiduous friends for a few months or more,
and then were no more seen about his house,
being banished by her; he was wont to call
such victims the Zephyrs after that squadron of
the mutinous in the Algerian army, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
receives all those condemned and rejected by
their chiefs. He would ask no questions; he
would understand that his old companion had
joined the rest; he had never cared for the
fate of any save for that of young Seliedoff.
There were always men by the score ready to
amuse, distract, and feast with Prince Napraxine.</p>

<p>She drank her yellow tea with its slice
of lemon, and enjoyed the unwonted repose
of half an hour&rsquo;s solitude. She was conscious
at once of a certain relief in the definite exile
of her late companion, yet of a certain magnanimity,
inasmuch as she would enable other
women to presume that he had grown tired of
his allegiance.</p>

<p>But the latter consideration weighed little
with her; she had been too satiated with
triumph not to be indifferent to it, and she
was at all times careless of the opinions of
others. She would miss him a little, as one
misses a well-trained servant, but there would
be so many others ready to fill his place.
Whenever her groom-of-the-chambers told her
hall-porter to say &lsquo;Madame reçoit,&rsquo; her rooms
were filled with young men ready to obey her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
slightest sign or wildest whim as poodles or
spaniels those of their masters. There were
not a few who, like Geraldine, regulated their
seasons and their sojourns by the capricious
movements of the Princess Napraxine, as poor
benighted shepherds follow the gyrations of
an ignis-fatuus. Whether north, south, east,
or west, wherever she was momentarily resident,
there was always seen her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de
garde</i>.</p>

<p>As she sat alone now for the brief half-hour
before her usual drive, her past drifted before
her recollection in clear colours, as though she
were quite old. She remembered her childhood,
spent at the embassies of great cities,
where her father was the idol of all that was
distinguished and of much that was dissolute;
the most courtly, the most witty, the most
elegant, of great diplomatists. She remembered
how, sitting in her mother&rsquo;s barouche in the
Bois or the Prater, or petted and caressed by
sovereigns and statesmen in her mother&rsquo;s
drawing-rooms, she had seen so much with her
opal-like eyes, heard so much with her sea-shell-like
ears, and had, at ten years old, said to
Count Platoff, &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je serai honnête femme; ce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
sera plus chic</i>;&rsquo; and how his peal of laughter
had disconcerted her own serious mood and
solemnity of resolve. Then she remembered
how, when she was seventeen years old, her
mother had advised her to marry her cousin;
and how her father, when she had been
tempted to ask his support of her own adverse
wishes, had twisted his silken white moustaches
with a little shrug of his shoulders, and had
said: &lsquo;Mais, mon enfant, je ne sais&mdash;nous
sommes presque ruinés; ça me plaira&mdash;et un
mari, c&rsquo;est si peu de chose!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si peu de chose!</i>&rsquo; she thought, now; and
yet a bullet that you drag after you, a note of
discord always in your music, a stone in your
ball slipper, dance you ever so lightly&mdash;an
inevitable ennui always awaiting you!</p>

<p>&lsquo;If they had not been in such haste, I
should have met Othmar and have married
him!&rsquo; she mused, with that frankness which
was never missing from her self-communion.
&lsquo;Life would have looked differently;&mdash;&mdash;I
would have made him the foremost man in
Europe; he has the powers needful, but he
has no ambitions; his millions have stifled
them.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>She thought, with something that was
almost envy, of the fate of Yseulte, and with
a remembrance, which was almost disgust, of
the early hours of her own marriage, when all
the delicacy and purity of her own girlhood
had revolted against the brutality of obligations
which she had in her ignorance submitted to
accept.</p>

<p>How could she care for the children born
of that intolerable degradation to which no
habit or time had had power to reconcile
her?</p>

<p>In her own eyes she had been as much
violated as any slave bought in the market.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I had daughters, they should at least
know to what they surrendered themselves
before they were given away in marriage,&rsquo; she
had often reflected, with a bitter remembrance
of the absolute innocence in which she herself
had repeated the vows, and broken the glass,
which had indissolubly united her to her cousin
Platon.</p>

<p>Then, with the irony even of herself, and
the doubt even of herself, which were stronger
than any other instincts in her, she laughed at
her own momentary sentiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;I dare say I should have been tired of
him in six months,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;and very
likely we should have hated one another in
another six. He would not have been as
easy as Platon; he would have had his prejudices&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Before her mind there rose the vision of a
place she had once seen as she had sailed in a
yacht down the Adriatic one cool autumnal
month; a place not far from Ragusa, somewhat
farther to the southward; a fantastic pile, half
Greek, half Turkish, with an old Gothic keep
built by Quattrocentisto Venetians rising in its
midst; gardens of palms and woods of ilex
sloping from it to meet the lapis-lazuli-hued
sea, cliffs of all the colours of precious stones
towering up behind it into the white clouds
and the dazzling sunshine. Fascinated by the
aspect of the place, she had asked its name and
owner, and the Austrians with her had
answered her, &lsquo;It is called Zama, and it
belongs to the Othmars.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had often remembered the Herzegovinian
castle, lonely as Miramar after the
tragedy of Quetaro.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would not have lived at Amyôt, but at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Zama,&rsquo; she thought now; then, angry and impatient
of herself, she dismissed her fancies as
you banish with a light clap of your hands a
flock of importunate birds, which fly away as
fast as they have come.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>


<p>&lsquo;Are you very happy?&rsquo; said Baron Fritz
to Yseulte in his occasional visits to Amyôt.
And she answered without words, with a blush
and a smile which were much warmer than
words. He saw that she was perfectly happy,
as yet; that whatever thorns might be beneath
the nuptial couch, they had not touched her.</p>

<p>He did not venture to put the same question
to Othmar. There were times when he would
no more have interrogated his nephew than he
would have put fire to a pile of powder; he
had at once the vague fear and the abundant
contempt which a thoroughly practical, artificial,
and worldly man has for one whose
dreams and desires are wholly unintelligible to
him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Otho,&rsquo; he said once to her, &lsquo;is like an
Eastern sorcerer who holds the magic ring with
which he can wish for anything under heaven;
but, as he cannot command immortality, all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
life slips through his fingers before he has decided
on what is most worth wishing for. Do
you understand?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte did not understand; to her this
sorcerer, if not benignant to himself, had at
least given all her soul desired. He treated
her with the most constant tenderness, with the
most generous delicacy, with the most solicitous
care; if in his love there might be some of the
heat of passion, some of the ardours of possession,
lacking, it was not the spiritual affection
and the childish innocence of so young a girl
which could be capable of missing those, or
be conscious of their absence. To Yseulte, love
was at once a revelation and a profanation:
she shrank from it even whilst she yielded to
it; it was not to such a temperament as hers
that any lover could ever have seemed cold.</p>

<p>She did not understand her husband; physical
familiarity had not brought much mental
companionship. She adored him; the distant
sound of his step thrilled her with excitement,
his lightest touch filled her with delight; the
intense love she bore him often held her silent
and pale with an excess of emotion which she
would have been afraid to render into speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
even if she had been able to do so; and she
was utterly unable, for the strength of her own
feelings alarmed her, and the mode of her
education had made her reticent.</p>

<p>He was to her as a god who had suddenly
descended upon her life, and changed all its
poor, dull pathways into fields of light. That
she gave, or that she might give him, much
more than he gave her, never occurred to her
thoughts. That any ardour of admiration, or
force of emotion, might be absent in him towards
her, never suggested itself to her. Such
love as he bestowed on her, indifferent though
it was in reality, seemed to her the very height
of passion. She could not tell that mere sensual
indulgences mingled with affectionate compassion,
may produce so fair a simulacrum of love
for awhile that it will deceive alike deceiver
and deceived.</p>

<p>Othmar knew that nothing tenderer, purer,
or nearer to his ideal, could have come into
his life than this graceful and most innocent
girl. She satisfied his taste if not his mind;
she was as fresh as a sea-shell, as a lily, as a
summer-dawn; and he felt an entire and illimitable
possession in her such as he had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
felt in any living woman; she was so young,
it seemed like drinking the very dew of morning;
and yet he could not have told whether
he was most restless or most in peace at
Amyôt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Love me a little, dear; I have no one,&rsquo;
he had said to her on the day of their betrothal,
and it had always seemed to him that
he had no one; all his mistresses had never
cared for him, but only for the golden god
which was behind him; or, he had thought so.
And now, she loved him with an innocence
and a fervour of which he could not doubt
the truth; and he was grateful, as the masters
of the world are usually grateful, for a handful
of the simple daily bread of real affection;
and she gave him all her young untouched
loveliness in pledge of that, as she might have
given him a rosebud to pluck to pieces. And
he felt the sweetness of the rosebud, he resigned
himself to the charm of the dawn, and endeavoured
to believe that he was happy; but
happiness escaped him as the vermilion hues of
the evening sky may escape the dreamer watching
for them, who looks too closely or looks
too far.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet he remained willingly at Amyôt through
these winter weeks; as willingly as though he
had been the most impassioned of lovers.
Amyôt was as far from the world, if he chose,
as though its pastures and avenues had been
an isle in the great South Ocean; he wished to
forget the world with the ivory arms of Yseulte
drawn about his throat: he would gladly have
forgotten that any other woman lived beside
this child, on whose innocent mouth, sweet as
the wild rose in spring, he strove to stay the
fleeting fragrance of his own youth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No man had ever sweeter physician to his
woes,&rsquo; he thought as he looked at her in her
sleep, the red glow from the angry winter sunrise
touching with its light the whiteness of
her sculptural limbs. But what drug cures for
long?</p>

<p>Friederich Othmar often went to the château
for a few hours on matters of business, and
was persuaded that the shining metal roofs of
the great Valois house of pleasure sheltered a
perfect contentment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you must not remain for ever here,&rsquo;
he said to his nephew. &lsquo;They will give you
some foolish name which will run down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
boulevards like magic; they will say you are
in love with your wife, or that you are educating
her; we all know what comes of that
latter attempt.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I stay at Amyôt,&rsquo; answered Othmar, &lsquo;because
I like it, because we both like it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Otho, since you have pleased
yourself persistently all your life, it is improbable
that you will cease to do so at an age
when most men are only just able to begin.
Amyôt is an historic place, very old, admirably
adapted for a museum; but since it is to your
taste, well and good; only none will comprehend
that you stay here <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filant le parfait amour</i>
for two months. If you continue to do so,
Paris will believe that your wife has a club-foot
or a crooked spine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You think she must show the one in a
cotillon, or the other in something <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">très collant</i>?&rsquo;
said Othmar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you afraid of that?&rsquo; said the Baron,
who knew by what means to attain his own
ends.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am not in the least afraid,&rsquo; replied
Othmar, with impatience. &lsquo;But I confess
Amyôt, with the cuckoo crying in its oak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
woods, seems a fitter atmosphere for her than
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">endiablement</i> of Paris.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You could return to the cuckoo. I am
not acquainted with his habits, but I should
presume he is a stay-at-home, countryfied
person.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You do not understand the spring-time,&rsquo;
said Othmar, with a smile.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It has always seemed to me the most uncomfortable
period of the year,&rsquo; confessed the
Baron. &lsquo;It is an indefinite and transitory
period, such as are seldom agreeable, except to
poets, who are naturally unstable themselves.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose you were never young?&rsquo; said
Othmar, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must have been, pathologically speaking,&rsquo;
replied Friederich Othmar. &lsquo;But I have no
recollection of it; I certainly never remember
a time when I did not read of the state of
Europe with interest: I think, on the contrary,
there was never a time in which you took any
interest in it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Europe is such a very small fraction of
such an immeasurable whole!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is our fraction at least; and all we
have,&rsquo; said the Baron; all the gist of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
matter seemed to him to lie in that. &lsquo;You
would like to live in Venus, or journey to the
rings of Saturn, but at present science limits us
to Earth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can you not persuade him to take any
interest in mankind?&rsquo; he continued to Yseulte,
as she approached them at that moment. He
was about to leave Amyôt after one of his
brief and necessary visits, and stood smoking
a cigarette before his departure in the great
central hall, with its dome painted by Primaticcio.</p>

<p>&lsquo;In mankind?&rsquo; she repeated with a smile.
&lsquo;That is very comprehensive, is it not? I am
sure,&rsquo; she added with hesitation, for she was
afraid of offending her husband, &lsquo;he is very
good to his own people, if you mean that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He does not mean that at all, my dear,&rsquo;
said Othmar. &lsquo;He means that I should be
very eager to ruin some states and upraise
others, that I should foment war and disunion,
or uphold anarchy or absolutism, as either best
served me, that I should free the hands of one
and tie the hands of another; do not trouble
your head about these matters, my child; let
us go in the woods and look for primroses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
which shall remind you of the green lanes of
Faïel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yseulte, whose interest was vaguely aroused,
looked from one to another.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you really can do so much as that,&rsquo;
she said timidly, &lsquo;I think I would do it if I
were you; because surely you might always
serve the right cause and help the weak people.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar smiled, well pleased.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear Baron, this is not the advocate that
you wish to arouse. Remember Mephistopheles
failed signally when he entered a cathedral.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not despair; I shall have Paris on
my side,&rsquo; said the Baron, as he made his farewells.</p>

<p>The day was bright, and a warm wind was
stirring amidst the brown buds of the trees and
forests; the great forests wore the purple haze
of spring; from the terraces of Amyôt, where
once Francis and the Marguerite des Marguerites
had wandered, the immense view
of the valleys of the Loire and of the Cher
was outspread in the noon sunlight, white
tourelle and grey church spire rising up
from amid the lake of golden air like &lsquo;silver
sails upon a summer sea.&rsquo; From these stately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
terraces, raised high on colonnades of marble,
with marble statues of mailed men-at-arms
standing at intervals adown their length, the
eyes could range over all that champaign
country which lies open like a chronicle of
France to those who have studied her wars and
dynasties.</p>

<p>Yseulte loved to come there when the sun
was bright as when it was at its setting, and
dream her happy dreams, whilst gazing over
the undulations of the great forests spreading
solemn and hushed and shadowy, away, far
away, to the silver line of the vast river and to
the confines of what once was Touraine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you find to think so much of,
you, with your short life and your blameless
conscience?&rsquo; asked Othmar that day, looking
at her as she leaned against the marble parapet.</p>

<p>She might have answered in one word,
&lsquo;You,&rsquo; but love words did not come easily to
her lips; she was very shy with him still.</p>

<p>She answered evasively: &lsquo;Does one always
think at all when one looks, and looks, and
looks, idly like this? I do not believe reverie
is real thinking; it is an enjoyment; everything
is so still, so peaceful, so bright&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
then it cannot go away, it is all yours; we
may leave it, it cannot leave us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very fond of the country?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have never been anywhere else, except
when I was a little child in Paris. I love
Paris, but it is not like this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No woman lives who does not love Paris;
but I think Amyôt suits you better. You have
a Valois look; you are of another day than
ours. I should not like to see you grow like
the women of your time; you are a true
patrician&mdash;you have no need of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chien</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He put a hothouse rose in her bosom as he
spoke, and kissed her throat as he did so. The
colour flushed there at his touch. She stooped
her face over the rose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not think I shall ever change,&rsquo; she
said, hurriedly. &lsquo;It seems to me as if one
must remain what one is born.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The ivory must; the clay changes,&rsquo; said
Othmar. &lsquo;You are very pure ivory, my love. I
robbed you from Christ.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was seated on one of the marble benches
in the balustrade of the terrace; she stood
before him, while his hand continued to play
with the rose he had put at her breast. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
wore a white woollen gown, which fell about
her in soft folds, edged with ermine; a broad
gold girdle clasped her waist, and old guipure
lace covered her heart, which beat warm and
high beneath his touch as he set the great
crimson rose against it. In an innocent way
she suddenly realised her own charm and its
power which it gave her over any man; she
lost her timidity, and ventured to ask him a
question.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is it that the Baron wishes you so
much to do?&rsquo; she said, as she stood before him.
&lsquo;I did not understand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He wishes me, instead of putting roses in
your corsage, to busy myself with setting the
torch of war to dry places.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not understand. What is it you can
do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will try and tell you in a few words.
There are a few men, dear, who have such an
enormous quantity of gold that they can
arrange the balance of the world much at
pleasure. One man, called Vanderbilt, could,
for instance, make such a country as England
bankrupt if he chose, merely by throwing his
shares wholesale on the market. The Othmar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
are such men as this. My forefathers made
immense fortunes, mostly very wickedly, and
by force of their own unscrupulousness have
managed to become one of these powers of the
world. I have no such taste for any such
power. It is with my indifference that my
uncle reproaches me. He thinks that if I
bestowed greater attention to the state of
Europe I could double the millions I possess.
I do not want to do that; I do not care to do
that; so a great chasm of difference yawns
for ever between him and me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He loves you very much?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, in his way; but I irritate him and
he irritates me. We have scarcely a point in
common.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said Yseulte, amazed at her own
boldness in suggesting a fault in him, &lsquo;perhaps
you have not quite patience with his difference
of character?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is very possible,&rsquo; said Othmar, himself
astonished at her insight. &lsquo;I could pardon
anything if he would not speak of the Othmar
as Jews speak of Jehovah. It is so intolerably
absurd.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But they are your people.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas! yes. But I despise them; I dislike
them. They were intolerably bad men, my
dear; they did intolerably bad things. All
this,&rsquo; he continued, with a gesture of his hand
towards the mighty building of Amyôt, with its
marble terraces and its many towers dazzling
in the sunlight, &lsquo;they would never have possessed
save through hundreds of unscrupulous
actions heaped one on the other to make
stepping-stones across the salt-marsh of poverty
to the yellow sands of fortune. Oh, I do not
mean that Amyôt was not bought fairly. It
was bought quite fairly, at a very high price,
by my great grandfather, but the wealth which
enabled him to buy it was ill-gotten. His
father was a common Croat horse-dealer, which
is a polite word for horse-stealer, who lived in
the last century in the city of Agram. There
are millions of loose horses in the vast oak
woods of Western Hungary and the immense
plains of Croatia, and to this day there are many
men who live almost like savages, and steal
these half-wild horses as a means of subsistence.
There were, of course, many more of these
robbers in the last century than in this. Marc
Othmar did not actually steal the horses, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
he bought them at a tenth part of their value
from these rough men of the woods and plains
when stolen, and the large profits he made by
this illegal traffic laid the foundations of the
much-envied fortunes which I enjoy, and which
you grace to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He had spoken as though he explained
the matter to a child, but Yseulte&rsquo;s ready
imagination supplied the colour to his bare
outlines. She was silent, revolving in her
thoughts what he had said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would rather your people had been warriors,&rsquo;
she said, with hesitation, thinking of her
own long line of crusaders.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would rather they had been peasants,&rsquo; he
returned. &lsquo;But being what they were, I must
bear their burdens.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then what is it he wishes you to do that
you do not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He wishes me to have many ambitions, but
as I regard it, the fortunes which I have been
born to entirely smother ambition; whatever
eminence I might achieve, if I did achieve it,
would never appear better than so much preference
purchased. If I had been as great a
soldier as Soult, they would have said I bought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
my victories. If I had had the talent of Balzac,
they would have said I bought the press.
If I had written the music of the &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;Roi de Lahore,&rdquo; they would have said
that I bought the whole musical world for my
claque. If I could have the life that I should
like, I should choose such a life as Lamartine&rsquo;s,
but a rival of the Rothschilds cannot be either
a poet or a leader of a revolution. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">monstrari
digito</i> ruins the peace and comfort of
life: if I walk down the boulevard with the
Comte de Paris the fools cry that I wish to
crown Philippe VII., if I speak to M. Wilson
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">foyer</i> of the Français they scream that
there is to be a concession for a new loan;
if the Prince Orloff come to breakfast with
me a Russian war is suspected, and if Prince
Hohenlohe dine with me I have too German
a bias. This kind of notoriety is agreeable
to my uncle. It makes him feel that he holds
the strings of the European puppet show.
But to myself it is detestable. To come and
go unremarked seems to me the first condition
of all for the quiet enjoyment of life,
but I have been condemned to be one of those
unfortunates who cannot drive a phaeton down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to Chantilly without the press and the public
becoming nervous about the intentions of M.
d&rsquo;Aumale. Last year, one very hot day, I was
passing through Paris, and I asked for a glass
of water at a little café at the barrière. They
stared, and brought me some. When I told
them that I only wanted water, the waiter said,
with a smile, &ldquo;Monsieur ne peut pas être sérieux!
nous avons l&rsquo;honneur de le connaître.&rdquo;
The world, like the waiter, will not let me have
plain water when I wish for it. I dare say
my wish may be perversity, but, at any rate, it
is always thwarted by the very people who
imagine they are gratifying me with indulgences.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But some of the people love you,&rsquo; she insisted.
&lsquo;Did not the workmen of Paris give
you that beautiful casket the other day? Was
it not bought by a two-sous subscription?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That was more a compliment to the Maison
d&rsquo;Othmar than to myself. We have always
been popular in Paris; so was Louis Napoléon&mdash;once.
We have much the same titles as he
had; we have committed many crimes, and
caused immeasurable misery.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not you,&rsquo; she said softly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;I inherit the results,&rsquo; said her husband.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you have done great things,&rsquo; she said
timidly. &lsquo;The curé here was telling me yesterday
of all you have done for the poor of
Paris. He says that the hospitals you have
founded, the charities you maintain&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The curé knows his way to your heart
and your purse! My dear, the Emperor
Napoléon Trois thought that he did a great
thing for the poor of Paris when he pulled
down their rookeries and built them fine and
healthy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cités ouvrières</i>; there was only one
thing the Emperor could not do: he could not
make the poor live in them; and the Convalescent
Home he erected at Vincennes did
not save him from Sedan, or Paris from the
Commune. We who are rich shall always have
the Emperor&rsquo;s fate; we shall build as much as
we like, and spend as much as we like, but we
shall never reach the hearts of the great
multitudes, who all hate us. It is very natural
they should. Never say a word about what
they call my charities. They are blunders
like the Emperor&rsquo;s, many of which seem now to
be very absurd ones. If I ever come to my
Sedan, they will not be remembered for an hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
The one thing I can do, and will do, is, that I
will prevent, as long as I live, the use of the
great mill of gold which we grind being turned
to immoral purposes&mdash;such purposes, for instance,
as the oppression of peoples, as the
barter of nationalities, as the supply of the
sinews of unjust and unholy wars, as the many
intolerable iniquities which, whilst professing
Christianity, modern statesmen employ under
spurious names to most intolerable ends. So
much I can do; and, for doing it, I am
thought a fool. All the rest is wholly indifferent
to me. The machine swings on as
it will; it is so admirably organised that it
requires little guidance, and, that little, Baron
Friederich gives, whilst I am free, my dear, to
stay at Amyôt and gather you another rose,
for I have spoilt this one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He had spoken more gaily, frankly, and
fully than was his wont, and kissed her softly
on the throat once more.</p>

<p>Yseulte&rsquo;s thoughts were with his earlier
words; her eyes were moist, and very serious.
It was the first time that he had ever alluded
before her to his family or his position; she
had never at all understood what they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
meant around her when they had spoken of la
Finance; she had seen that he was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">très grand
seigneur</i>, and was treated, wherever he moved,
with the greatest marks of deference. It
seemed very strange to her that so much power
and state should be possible without unblemished
descent: it was outside of her creed and
her comprehension. If she had loved him
less, it would have shocked her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; she said softly, &lsquo;it must have
troubled you so much. I understand why you
are sometimes sad. It must be like holding
lightning in your hands; and then there is the
fear of using it ill&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My greatest fault has been to be too
careless of it,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;To have used
my power neither way, neither for good nor
ill. I have comforted myself that I have done
no harm;&mdash;a negative praise. Come, let us go
and choose another rose for you; or shall we
go into the woods? You like them better.
Do not trouble your soul with the gold or the
crimes of the Othmar. You are come to purify
both; and you will make your children in
your own likeness out of that consecrated ivory
of which heaven has made you!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;She is the first woman of them all,&rsquo; he
thought, as they descended the marble stairs
towards the glades of the park, &lsquo;the first who
has had any sympathy with me. They have all
thought me a fool for not turning round like
the sluggard, and lying drugged in my golden
nest. She understands very little because she
does not understand the world; but she can
imagine how all which the vulgar think so
delightful drags me down like a wallet of
stones.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yseulte,&rsquo; he said aloud, &lsquo;do you know
what all my millions cannot buy, and what
I would give them all to be able to buy? Well,
something like the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mort sur le champ d&rsquo;honneur</i>,
which was said for a hundred and fifty years
when the name of Philippe de Valogne was
called in the roll-call of the Grenadiers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The memory he recalled was one of the most
glorious of her race; one of those traditions of
pure honour which are common enough in the
nobility of France. The Counts de Valogne
had been behind none in high courage and lofty
codes; and the local history of their province
was studded with the exploits and the martial
self-sacrifice whereby they had continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
redeemed their extravagance and their idleness
as courtiers and men of pleasure.</p>

<p>She turned to him with her brightest smile,
and her hand touched his with a gesture
caressing and timid.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is mine; I will give him to you,&rsquo; she
said, with a child&rsquo;s abandonment and gaiety.
&lsquo;I am so glad that I have something to give!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will give his blood to my sons,&rsquo; said
Othmar. &lsquo;So you will give it to me.&rsquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
</div>


<p>Melville came one day to Amyôt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have followed my advice,&rsquo; he said to
Othmar. &lsquo;You have made yourself a home.
It is the nearest likeness to heaven that men
get on earth. Believe a homeless man when
he tells you so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Othmar smiled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is odd that you, the purest priest I know,
and my uncle, the worldliest of philosophers
and money-makers, should coincide in your
counsels. Perhaps to make a home is as
difficult as to make a discovery in astronomy
or mathematics, or to appreciate a sunrise or
sunset.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say?&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I mean to say nothing in especial; except
that one&rsquo;s life, as the world goes, does not fit
one to be the hourly companion of a perfectly
virginal mind. My dear Melville, she makes me
ashamed; my society seems infinitely too coarse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
for her. I have never seemed to myself such
a brute.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is, I fear, because you are not very
much in love, and so are at liberty to analyse
your own sensations: a lover would not feel
those scruples,&rsquo; reflected Melville; but he
merely said aloud: &lsquo;If a woman have not a
little of the angelic, she goes near to having
something of the diabolic. Women are always
in extremes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Her soul is like a crystal,&rsquo; said Othmar.
&lsquo;But in it I see my own soul, and it looks unworthy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He could not say even to Melville, tried
physician of sick souls as he was, that there
were moments when the perfect purity of the
young girl wearied him, when her innocent
tenderness fretted him, and failed to supply all
the stimulant to his senses that women less
lovely but more versed in amorous arts could
have given, when he was, in a word&mdash;the most
fatal word love ever hears&mdash;wearied.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
</div>


<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Othmar cueillant les marguerites aux bois!</i>&rsquo;
said Nadine Napraxine, with her most unkind
smile, when she heard that he remained
under the Valois woods until autumn.</p>

<p>She herself was in Russia; forced also to
gather daisies in her own manner, which always
wearied her. It was necessary to be seen
awhile at Tsarkoe Selo, or wherever the
Imperial people were; and then to visit for
a few months the immense estates of Prince
Napraxine. They had gone thither earlier
than usual through the suicide of Boris Seliedoff,
which had cast many noble northern
families into mourning, and had for a moment
chilled the feeling of Europe in general towards
herself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was so inconsiderate of him!&rsquo; she said
more than once. &lsquo;Everyone was sure to put
it upon me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>It seemed to her very unjust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>She had been kind to the boy, and then had
rebuked him a little as anybody else would
have done. Who could imagine that he would
blow his brains out under the palms and aloes,
like any <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décavé</i> without a franc?</p>

<p>She was exceedingly angry that the world
should venture to blame her. When her Imperial
mistress, receiving her first visit, gave
some expression to this general sentiment, and
presumed to hazard some phrases which suggested
a hint of reproof, Nadine Napraxine
revolted with all the pride of her temper, and
did not scruple to respond to her interlocutor
that the Platoff and the Napraxine both were
of more ancient lineage and greater traditions
in Russia than those now seated on the throne.</p>

<p>To her alone would it have been possible
to make such a reply and yet receive condonation
of it, as she did. There was in her a
force which no one resisted, a magnetism which
no one escaped.</p>

<p>She was, however, extremely angered, both
by the remarks made to her at Court, and
about her in European society, and withdrew
herself to the immense solitudes of the province
of Kaluga in an irritation which was not with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>out
dignity. Men who adored her, of whom
there were many, noticed that her self-exile to
Zaraïzoff coincided with that of Othmar to
Amyôt; but there was no one who would have
dared to say so. Geraldine had gone to North
America, which had amused her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>He</em> will not shoot himself,&rsquo; she thought.
&lsquo;He will shoot a vast number of innocent
beasts instead. Seliedoff was the manlier of
the two.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Zaraïzoff was a mighty place set amongst
the endless woods and rolling plains of the
north-eastern provinces; a huge rambling structure
half fortress, half palace, with the village
clustering near as in other days when the
Tartars might sweep down on it like vultures.
The wealth of the Napraxines had made it
within almost oriental in its luxury; without, it
had much of the barbaric wildness of the
country, and it had been here in the first two
intolerable years after her marriage that she
had learned to love to be drawn by half-wild
horses at lightning speed over the snow plains,
with the bay of the wolves on the air, and the
surety of fatal frost-bite if the furs were incautiously
dropped a moment too soon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>At Zaraïzoff, when she established herself
there for the summer, she brought usually a
Parisian household with her, and inviting a succession
of guests, filled with a great movement
and gaiety of life the sombre courts, the silent
galleries and chambers, the antique walls all
covered with vivid paintings like a Byzantine
church, the long low salons luxurious as a
Persian harem. But this summer it saw her
come almost alone. Her children came also
from southern Russia, and Platon Napraxine
at least was happy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is it possible to be uglier than that; not
surely among the Kalmucks!&rsquo; she thought,
looking in the good-tempered little Tartar-like
faces of her two small sons.</p>

<p>They were absurdly like their father; but,
as they promised to be also, like him, tall and
well-built, would probably, as they grew up,
find many women, as he had found many, to
tell them they were handsome men; but that
time was far off, and as yet they were but ugly
children. Sachs and Mitz (Alexander and
Demetrius) were respectively five and six years
old, big, stout, ungainly little boys, with flat
blunt features, in which the Tartar blood of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Napraxine was prominently visible. They had
a retinue of tutors, governesses, bonnes, and
attendants of all kinds, and had been early
impressed with the opinion that a Napraxine
had no superior on earth save the Gospodar.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ils ont pris la peine de naître!</i>&rsquo; quoted
their mother with contempt as she beheld their
arrogant little pomposities: she could never
forgive them that they had done so. It was
natural that when she looked in her mirror she
could scarcely bring herself to believe that they
had been the issue of her own life.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose I ought to adore them, but I
certainly do not,&rsquo; she said to Melville, who,
having been sent on a mission to Petersburg
by the Vatican in the vain hope of mitigating
by the charm of his manner the hard
fate of the Catholic Poles, had paused for a
day at Zaraïzoff to obey the summons of its
mistress, travelling some extra thousand versts
to do so. It was to him that she had made
the remark about the daisies.</p>

<p>Melville, though he was a priest whose
vows were truly sacred obligations in his eyes,
was also keenly alive to those enjoyments of
the graces and luxuries of life which his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
frequent employment in diplomatic missions for
the head of his Church made it not only permissible
but desirable for him to indulge in
at times. His brief visit to Zaraïzoff, and other
similar diversions, were agreeable episodes in
months of spiritual effort and very serious
intellectual work, and he abandoned himself
to the amusement of such occasional rewards
with the youthful ardour which sixty years had
not tamed in him.</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine was not only charming
to his eyes and taste, as to those of all men,
but she interested him with the attraction which
a complicated and not-easily-unravelled character
possesses for all intellectual people. He
had perceived in her those gifts mental and
moral which, under suitable circumstance, make
the noblest of temperaments, and he also perceived
in her an indefinite potentiality for
cruelty and for tyranny; the conflict between
the two interested him as a psychological study.
He could not but censure her intolerance of
Napraxine; yet neither could he refuse to sympathise
with it. The Prince was the last man
on earth to have been able to attain any power
over that variable, contemptuous, and subtle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
temperament and over an intelligence refined
by culture to the utmost perfection of taste and
hypercriticism of judgment. He adored her
indeed, but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">c&rsquo;est le pire défaut</i> in such cases;
and a hippopotamus in his muddy sedges might
have done so, with as much hope as he, of
exciting anything more than her impatience
and contempt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I certainly do not,&rsquo; she repeated, as she
lay on a divan after dinner, in a grand hall imitated
from the Alhambra, with a copy of the
Lion fountain in white marble in the centre, and
groves of palms in white marble vases lifting
their green banners against the deep glow of
the many-coloured fretwork and diapered gold
of the walls. &lsquo;They are two quite uninteresting
children, stupid, obstinate, proud, already
convinced that a Prince Napraxine has only to
breathe a wish to see it accomplished. At
present they are good tempered and are fond
of each other, but that will not last long;
they will soon feel their claws and use them.
They are quite wonderfully ugly;&mdash;an ugliness
flat, heavy, animal, altogether Tartar. I imagine
I could have been fond of a child like
any other woman, but then I think with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
mother it must be always the child of a man
she loves; it must be the symbol of sympathy
and the issue of joy&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She spoke dreamily, almost regretfully, her
delicate head lying back amongst the pillows
of golden silk, while she sent a little cloud of
smoke into the air.</p>

<p>Melville looked at her: he thought that
there were persons who were like the Neva
river; the Neva does not freeze of itself, but it
has so many huge blocks of ice rolled down
into it from above that it looks as if it did.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment; he was too sagacious
a man of the world to intrude his own beliefs
where they would only have met with unbelief.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What can I say?&rsquo; he murmured. &lsquo;Only
that I suppose maternal love, after all, like all
other love, does not come at command; human
nature has always been under the illusion that
it was a spontaneous and irresistible growth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Human nature has so many illusions,&rsquo; said
Nadine Napraxine. &lsquo;But I have never heard
that much reason underlies any one of them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But does not our happiness?&rsquo; said Melville.</p>

<p>She laughed a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you believe much in happy people?
I think there are passions, vanities, titillations,
desires, successes&mdash;those one sees in full motion
on the earth, like animalculæ in a drop of
water; but happiness, I imagine, died with
Paul et Virginie, with Chactas and Atala. To
be happy, you must be capable of being unhappy.
We never reach that point; we are
only irritable, or grow <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anémique</i>, according
to the variety of our constitutions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I knew a perfectly happy woman once,&rsquo;
said Melville; &lsquo;happy all her life, and she lived
long.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you mean some nun,&rsquo; said Nadine
Napraxine, with impatience. &lsquo;That is not
happiness; it is only a form of hysteria or
hypogastria.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not a nun,&rsquo; replied Melville, making himself
a cigarette, while the sun played on the
red sash of his gown, the gown which Raffael
designed for Leo. &lsquo;Not a nun. The woman
I mean was a servant in a little dirty village
near Grenoble; she had been in the service of
two cross, miserly people ever since she was
fifteen. At the time I knew her first she was
forty-seven. The old people had a small shop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
general necessaries; she attended to the shop,
cooked, and cleaned, and washed, and spun,
dug, too, in a vegetable garden, and took care
of a donkey, and pigs, and fowls. When she
was about thirty, the old man first, and then the
old woman, became incapable, from paralysis.
Rose&mdash;her name was Rose&mdash;worked on harder
than ever. She had many offers of better service,
even offers of marriage, for she was a
famous housewife, but she refused them; she
would not leave the old people. They were
poor; they had never been good or grateful to
her; they had even beaten her when she was a
girl; but she would never leave them. She
had been a foundling, and theirs had been the
only form of human ties that she had ever
known. She was perfectly happy all the day
long, and she even found time to do many a
good turn for neighbours worse off than herself.
She had never had more than twenty francs a
year in money, but then &ldquo;you see, I live well, I
want nothing,&rdquo; she said to me once. And such
living! Black cabbage and black bread! Well,
she was perfectly happy, as I say. You do not
seem to believe it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes; so is a snail,&rsquo; said the Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
Nadine. &lsquo;Besides, you know, if she had been
a pretty woman&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Melville felt almost angry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are very cruel. Why will you divorce
beauty and virtue?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not divorce them, nature usually does,&rsquo;
she answered, amused. &lsquo;Perhaps they divorce
themselves. Well, what became of this paragon?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She was no paragon,&rsquo; said Melville, annoyed.
&lsquo; She was a hard-working, good, honest
woman, perfectly content with a horrible lot,
and loyal unto death to two tyrannical old
brutes who never thanked her. When they
died they left all the little they had to a nephew
in the Jura, who had taken no notice of them
all their days&mdash;a rich tradesman. Poor Rose,
at fifty-three years old, was sent adrift on the
world. She cried her heart out to have to
leave the house, and the ass, and the chickens.
I got her the grant from the Prix Montyon,
and she was set up in a tiny shop of her own
in her own village, but she did not live long.
&ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quand on a été heureuse, après&mdash;c&rsquo;est long</i>,&rdquo;
she said in her dying hour. She was afraid
to seem ungrateful, but &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sans mes vieux</i>,&rdquo; as
she said, apologetically, her life was done. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
seems a terrible life to us, but I can solemnly
declare that it was one of the few happy ones
of which I have ever been witness. There is a
sustaining, vivifying force in duty, like the heat
of the sun, for those who accept it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;For those who accept it, no doubt,&rsquo; said
Nadine Napraxine, drily; &lsquo;but then, you see,
my dear and reverend Melville, it requires some
organ in one&rsquo;s brain&mdash;superstition, I think, or
credulity&mdash;before one can do that. Every one
is not blessed with that organ. Pray believe,&rsquo;
she resumed, with her softer smile, perceiving
a vexed shadow on his face, &lsquo;I am not insensible
to the quiet unconscious heroism of those
lowly lives of devotion. They are always
touching. Those revelations which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">discours</i>
of the Prix Montyon give from time to time
always make one envious of so much belief,
of so much endurance, of so much unobtrusive
and unselfish goodness. But, though I dare say
you will be very angry, I cannot help reminding
you that what makes the sparrow very happy
would have no sort of effect on the swallow, except
that he would feel restless and uncomfortable;
and also that&mdash;pray forgive me, for you
are a priest&mdash;to be contented with doing one&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
duty one must believe in duty as a Divine ordinance.
To do that one must have&mdash;well, just
that bump of credulity of which I spoke&mdash;of
easy, unquestioning, unintelligent, credulity.
Now, that it is a happy quality I am certain,
but is it,&mdash;is it, an intellectual one?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She spoke very sweetly, but with a demure
smile, which made Melville feel that there was
a great deal more which she did not say out of
respect for his sacred calling and his position
as her guest.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do not repeat over to me all the stock
arguments,&rsquo; she said quickly, as he opened his
lips; &lsquo;I have heard them all ten thousand times.
I have the greatest possible regard for your
doctrines, which have satisfied Chateaubriand,
Lacordaire, Montalembert, Manning, Newman,
and yourself, but I have always failed to understand
how they did satisfy any of you. But
we will not discuss theology. Your poor Rose
proves, if she prove anything, that Heaven is
not in a hurry to reward its servitors. Perhaps,
after all, she might have been wiser if she had
married some Jeannot, all over flour or coal dust,
and had half a dozen children and fifty grand
children.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;There is common brute enjoyment all over
the earth,&rsquo; said Melville, almost losing his
temper. &lsquo;It must be well that it should be
leavened here and there with lives of sublime
self-sacrifice; one heroic or unselfish act raises
the whole of human nature with it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine took a cigarette.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There are ten thousand such acts in Russia
every year, but they do not produce much
effect. Juggernauth rolls on,&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Melville looked at her quickly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have a certain sympathy with the
people, though you deride my poor Rose.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not deride her; I admire her within
certain limits. Only, I ascribe her actions more
to ignorance and to superstition, whereas you
ascribe them entirely to a clear-eyed devotion.
Yes; I could have been a revolutionist, I think,
only all the traditions of the Platoff and the
Napraxine forbid it; and then, as I said to you
once before, I do not like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pallida Mors</i> carried
about in a hat-box or a sardine-case. It is grotesque.
Without jesting,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;I think
if I saw my way to do something truly great or
of lasting benefit, I should be ready to sacrifice
my life to it; but there is nothing. If a Princess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Napraxine joined the Nihilists, she would only
cause an intolerable scandal and set an example
which would be very injurious to the country
at large. Some day, Russia will be in revolt
from one end to another, but the day is not
yet, and I doubt much that any good will be
done when it comes. The evil lies too deep,
in the drunkenness, in the lying, in the
bestiality&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She saw a look of surprise on Melville&rsquo;s
face, and continued quickly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you suppose I never think? I believe I
have read every socialistic writer from Rousseau
to Bakounine. They do not convince me of
anything except of the utter improbability that
any real liberty will ever be obtainable from
any congregation of men. Humanity is tyrannical
and slavish at once; its governments are
created in its own likeness, it makes little
difference what they are called, they are
human offspring, so they are narrow and arrogant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor humanity!&rsquo; said Melville. &lsquo;It is
only we priests who can lend it wings.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because you say to it, like Schiller, &ldquo;Cheat
yourself, and dream,&rdquo;&rsquo; she replied. &lsquo;But even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
there how narrow still! You say to each unit,
"Save yourself!"&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Englishman with good
temper, &lsquo;if every one sweep out his own
little chamber, the whole city will be clean.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The city will be for ever unclean. You
know that as well as I do. Only, all Churchmen
can hide their eyes ostrich-like in the sand
of sonorous phrases. Your Christianity has
been toiling for eighteen centuries, and, one
may say, has accomplished nothing. It mouths
a great deal, but practical result it has scarcely
any. Its difficulty has always been that, being
illogical in its essence and traditions, it must
be restrained to words. Reduced to practice,
all the modern world would fade away, riches
would disappear, effort would be impossible,
and the whole machinery of civilisation come
to a standstill and entire disuse. You are as
aware of that as I am, only you do not like to
say so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She rose, amused at his discomfiture, and
lighted another cigarette. She smoked as
gracefully as a bird pecks at the dew in a rose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She is the only woman who makes me
irritable,&rsquo; the courtly Gervase Melville had once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
said of her, and he might have said also, &lsquo;the
only woman who reduces me to silence.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Allow, Princess,&rsquo; he said irritably now,
&lsquo; that whether we accredit Christianity with
it or not, the life of poor Rose in her wooden
shoes was much more useful than yours is in
those pearl-embroidered <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mules</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; she answered with a smile. &lsquo;You
are indeed worsted in your logic if you must
descend to personalities! Certainly I grant
that; my life is of a most absolute inutility.
It is, perhaps, now and then useful to my tailors,
because I give them ideas they would not have
without me. But to no one else. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">À qui la faute?</i>
I arrived in this world without any option.
As Mr. Gladstone said when he was an Eton
boy, responsibilities which are thrust upon us
do not exact our obedience. It is the only
sentiment of Mr. Gladstone with which I have
ever been able to agree. Life is clearly thrust
upon us. We none of us seek it, that is
certain. If we are able to disport ourselves in
it, like butterflies in a south wind, it says much
in praise of the lightness of our hearts.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Or of the levity of our consciences,&rsquo; said
Melville, a little gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Conscience is only the unconscious cerebral
action of transmitted influence, is it? Oh,
I have read the Scientists as well as the Socialists.
They are not much more convincing, if one
goes to them with an unprejudiced mind&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Does your conscience never tell you that
you have done any harm, Princess?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, very often&mdash;a great deal,&rsquo; she answered
candidly. &lsquo;But it does not tell me that I ought
not to have done it. I suppose my chain of
transmitted influences is not as strong as it
should be. Seriously,&rsquo; she continued, &lsquo;I do not
think hereditary influences are nearly sufficiently
allowed for at any time. Think what
my people were for ages and ages; the most
masterful of autocratic lords who had no single
law save their own pleasure, and who, when
they helped slay a Tzar, were washing out
some blood-feud of their family; pleasure, vice,
bloodshed, courage no doubt, rough justice
perhaps, were all their lives knew; they lived
in the saddle or beside the drinking-horn; they
rode like madmen; they had huge castles set in
almost eternal snows; they were the judge and
the executioner of every wrong-doer in their
family or their province; it was not until Letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
came in with the great Catherine that the least
touch of civilisation softened them, and even
after Catherine they were amongst the slayers of
Paul; for though they could read Bossuet and
Marmontel, their culture was but the merest
varnish still. Now, I come from these men
and women, for the women were not better
than the men. Do you suppose their leaven
is not in me? Of course it is, though I am&mdash;perhaps
as civilised as most people.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Melville looked at her with a smile.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, certainly civilisation has in you,
Princess, reached its most exquisite and most
supreme development; the hothouse can do no
more. You are its most perfect flower. Are
we really to credit that you have beneath all
that the ferocity and the despotism of a thousand
centuries of barbaric Boyars?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have no doubt something of it,&rsquo; said
Nadine Napraxine, whilst the dark velvet of
her eyes grew sombre and her delicate hand
clenched on an imaginary knout. &lsquo;I could use
<em>that</em> sometimes,&rsquo; she said with significance:
Melville understood what she meant.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You can hurt more than with the knout,
Princess,&rsquo; he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine smiled. The suggestion
pleased her.</p>

<p>Then a certain regretfulness came upon her
face.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think I might have been tender-hearted,&rsquo;
she said involuntarily and inconsistently, with a
pathos of which she was unconscious. &lsquo;I do not
know&mdash;perhaps not&mdash;I am not compassionate.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She forgot that Melville was seated on a
divan near her in the great golden room of
Moorish work, whose arches opened on to the
marble court of the Lion. She thought of
her spoilt, artificial, frivolous childhood, spent
in great drawing-rooms listening to political
rivalries and calumnious stories and wit that
was always polished but not always decent;
she thought how her keen eyes had unravelled
all the threads of intrigue about her, and how
her heart had scorned the duplicity of her
mother; when she had been only eight years
old, she had known by intuition her mother&rsquo;s
secrets and had shut them all up in her little
silent soul with vague ideas of honour and
dishonour, and never had said anything to her
father&mdash;never, never&mdash;not even when he lay
on his deathbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>And then they had married her to Platon
Napraxine as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si bon garçon</i>. &lsquo;Oh, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si bon
garçon</i>, no doubt!&rsquo; she had thought contemptuously
then as she thought now&mdash;only he
had outraged her, revolted her, disgusted her.
Her marriage night still remained to her a
memory of ineffaceable loathing.</p>

<p>She looked up to see the intelligent eyes of
Melville fixed on her in some perplexity.</p>

<p>She laughed and walked out on to the
marble pavement of the great court, above
which shone the blue of a northern sky; beyond
its colonnades were immense gardens,
and beyond those stretched the plains like a
green sea covered with forests of birch and
willow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think I should have liked to be your
Rose,&rsquo; she said, as she did so. &lsquo;After all, she must
have been content with herself when she died.
A philosopher can be no more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A philosopher can rarely be as much,&rsquo; said
Melville. &lsquo;He may be resigned, but resignation
and content are as different as a cold hand
and a warm one. My poor Rose was certainly
content whilst she lived, but not when she died,
for she thought she had not done nearly enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
in return for all the blessings which she had
received throughout her life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now you cannot get that kind of absurdly
grateful feeling without pure ignorance,&rsquo; said
Nadine Napraxine, a little triumphantly. &lsquo;It
would be impossible for an educated person to
think that misery was comfort; so you see,
after all, ignorance is at the bottom of all
virtue. Now in your heart of hearts, you
cannot deny that, because, though you are a
priest, you are beyond anything a man of the
world?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Melville did not dislike to be called a man
of the world, for he was one, and liked to
prove, or think he proved, that worldly wisdom
was not incompatible with the spiritual life.</p>

<p>At that moment Napraxine crossed the
court. It was the first of the brief hours
between sunset and sunrise; there was a full
moon in the midsummer skies; he was smoking
a cheroot, and talking with some young men,
neighbouring gentlemen, who had dined there;
he looked big and coarse, and his face was
red; his wife gazed at him with an intolerant
dislike; he could have a grand manner when
he chose, but in the country he &lsquo;let himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
go;&rsquo; he did not remember that he was in
the presence of the most inexorable of his
critics, of the most implacable of his enemies,
of the one person in the whole world whom it
would have been most desirable, and was most
impossible, for him to propitiate.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sachs turned the knife round and round
in the wolf&rsquo;s throat; he did, on my honour,
while it was alive; we blooded him at five
years old, and the child never winked. When
the blood splashed him he shouted!&rsquo; he was
saying audibly, with much pride, to one of his
guests, as he lounged across the marble court.
Sachs was his eldest son. He was relating
a hunting exploit, crowned by the presence of
his heir.</p>

<p>Nadine glanced at Melville with an expression
of sovereign contempt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Butchers before they can spell!&rsquo; she said,
with ineffable distaste.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Shall I venture to say anything?&rsquo; he
murmured.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It would be of no use. Slaughter is the
country gentleman&rsquo;s god. Prince Napraxine
is just now wholly <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourré</i> in his character of
a country gentleman. It is perhaps as useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
as that of a Monte Carlo gamester. Only here
the beasts suffer&mdash;there, the fools. I prefer
that the fools should do so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young men gathered about her; Napraxine
approached Melville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How does the Othmar marriage succeed?&rsquo;
he asked. &lsquo;I suppose you have seen them?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have been once to Amyôt,&rsquo; returned
Melville. &lsquo;You know Amyôt? A magnificent
place. They appeared very happy. She seems
to have grown years in a month or two.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That of course,&rsquo; said Napraxine, with his
loud laugh. &lsquo;She is very handsome. Why on
earth do they stay on in the provinces?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She is fond of Amyôt,&rsquo; replied Melville.
&lsquo;Probably he thinks that as she is so young,
there is time and to spare for the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps Nadine will believe now that it is
a love marriage?&rsquo; insisted her husband, turning
towards her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did I ever say it was not?&rsquo; she replied,
with a little yawn.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not see, if it were not, why it should
possibly have taken place,&rsquo; said Melville.
&lsquo;Othmar is lord of himself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;With a slave for his master?&rsquo; she mur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>mured,
too low to be heard by the not quick
ears of her husband.</p>

<p>Melville heard, and the doubt crossed him
whether Othmar might not have been the lover
of the Princess Napraxine, and the marriage
arranged by her, as great ladies often arrange
such matters to disarm suspicion; for Melville,
despite the acumen on which he prided himself,
did not by any means wholly understand the
very complicated character of his hostess, in
which a supreme courage was to the full as
strong as were its disdain and its indifference.</p>

<p>She shook off the importunities of the
young nobles, who seemed rustic and tiresome
enough to a woman to whom the wittiest society
of Europe had seemed dull and too tame, and
strolled by herself through the half wild gardens,
which reached and touched the virgin
forests of the East. Her Kossack Hetman,
who never lost her from sight when she was
out of doors, paced at a respectful distance
behind her, but he was no more to her than a
big dog would be to others. The high seeding
grass which grew in the unused paths
screened him from sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>As she looked back, the moonlit mass of the
vast house gathered a dignity and austerity not
its own by daylight, but to her it only resembled
a prison. She hated it: she would
have liked to raze it to the ground and make
an end of it. There were so many prisons in
Russia!</p>

<p>She laughed a little to herself, not mirthfully,
as she strolled through the intense light
of the Northern night, her Kossack following
like her shadow. A poor drudge like that
servant woman in Jura had been content with
her life, whilst she, the Princess Napraxine,
in all the perfection of youth, beauty, and
great rank, was often so dissatisfied with it
that she could have drugged herself out of it
with morphine from sheer ennui!</p>

<p>What was the use of the highest culture,
if that was all it brought you? A whimsical
fancy crossed her that she wished her Kossack
would try and assassinate her; it would be
something new, it might make her life seem
worth the having, if somebody would try and
take it away. She was only three-and-twenty
years old, and her future seemed so immensely
long that she felt tired at the very prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
it, as one feels tired at the sight of a long dull
road which one is bound to follow.</p>

<p>The eternal monotony of the great world
would be for ever about her. She had too
great rank, too great riches, for ambition to
present any prizes to her. To attempt to
thrust Platon Napraxine into high offices of the
State would have been as absurd as to make a
bear out of Finland a magistrate or a general.
He was a very great noble, but he would never
have wit enough even to play a decent hand at
whist, much less to conduct a negotiation or
sway a Council.</p>

<p>&lsquo;One might have had ambition for Othmar,&rsquo;
she thought involuntarily, as his image rose
unsummoned from the sea of silvery shadows
around her; &lsquo;he had none for himself, but he
might have been spurred, stimulated, seduced,
by a woman he had loved. There would have
been many things possible to him; the financier
is the king, the Merlin, of the modern world,
and might become its Arthur also.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She thought with impatience of that summer
night, as it was shining on the towers and woods
of Amyôt. She felt as if something of her
own had been stolen from her, some allegiance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
due to her unlawfully transferred. He should
have had patience, he should have waited on
her will, he should have accepted her rebuffs,
he should have followed her steps through life
as the Kossack was following them through the
dewy grass.</p>

<p>Poor stupid Geraldine would have been
grateful to do so much, or Seliedoff, or so
many others. Othmar alone had dared to say
to her, &lsquo;I will be nothing or all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Therefore his memory abided with her and
moved her, and had power over her, and at
times an irritable gnawing sense of something
which might have been stole upon her. What
could that child give him at Amyôt?&mdash;white
limbs, clear eyes, a rose-bloom of blushes; but
besides? what sympathy, comprehension, inspiration?
what of the higher delights of the
passions?</p>

<p>The thought of him irritated her. There
was a defiance, an insolence, in his assumption
of being able to command his destiny in independence
of herself, which offended her; it was
unlike what others did. She was aware that it
was done out of bravado, or so she believed;
but it was not thus that the fates on which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
had deigned to lay her finger had usually been
closed. Something even of contempt for him
at seeking such a refuge from herself mingled
with her irritation. It seemed to her weak
and commonplace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Madame,&rsquo; said the voice of Melville
through the shadows, &lsquo;is it quite safe to
ramble so late, despite the trusty Kossack and
his lance?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She turned; her head enwrapped in gossamer,
till he saw nothing but the cloud of lace
and the two dusky, jewel-like eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was just wishing, almost wishing,&rsquo; she
answered, &lsquo;that the trusty Kossack were of the
new doctrines, and would take advantage of
the opportunity to make away with his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barina</i>.
I am not sure that I would have called out; it
would have saved one a great deal of sameness.
When my chocolate comes to my bedside I
always think of Pierre Loti&rsquo;s childish protest,
&ldquo;Toujours se lever, toujours se coucher, et
toujours manger de la soupe qui n&rsquo;est pas
bonne!&rdquo; Our soup is good, perhaps. It is
rather the appetite which is lacking.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your generation is born tired,&rsquo; said Melville.
&lsquo; Mine was happier; it believed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
the possibility of enjoyment&mdash;an illusion, no
doubt, but one which cheers life considerably.
Princess, I wish you would pardon me an
indiscretion; you are always so merciful to me,
you make me over-bold; but I have always so
much wanted to know whether a story that I
heard, of a winter&rsquo;s journey of yours across
Russia, was true. It was in the newspapers,
but one never knows what is true there, and I
was in India at the time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She smiled. &lsquo;Oh! I know what you mean.
Yes, it was true enough. That was nothing;
nothing at all. I had all kinds of people to
help me. There was no difficulty of any sort.
It was amusing&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was a very heroic thing to do,&rsquo; said
Melville gravely.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; she interrupted quickly.
&lsquo;There was no heroism about it. The Tzar was
always very kind to me. I had every assistance,
every comfort on my journey. You,
imaginative being, have a picture instantly
in your mind of me as enduring all the dangers
of poor Elizabeth in the French classic; on the
contrary, I slept nearly all the way, and read
a novel the rest.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;All the same,&rsquo; said Melville, &lsquo;no one but
yourself will deny that it was a very noble
thing to travel in November, the most hideous
part of the year, through mud and snow, right
across Russia, to have a few facts reach the
Emperor in their true aspect, and then post to
Tobolsk with his pardon, that a dying mother
might know her son was free before she
died&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nadine Napraxine shrugged her shoulders
slightly, with a gesture of indifference.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It amused me. I had a fancy to see
Siberia in winter. The pity was that Fedor
Alexowitch Boganof was an ugly and uninteresting
fellow&mdash;with plenty of brains, indeed,
which brought his ruin, but quite ugly, rather
misshapen, and blessed with five children. If
the hero of my journey had only been a fine
officer of cuirassiers, or a romantic-looking revolutionist,
the story would have been delightful,
but poor Boganof no one could turn into a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeune premier</i>; not even the gossips of
Petersburg. He was only a clever writer, with
a mother and a wife who idolised him. The
truth is, I had read his novel and liked it;
that is why, when his people came to me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
did what I could. Anybody who knew the
Tzar as well as I could have done as much.
As for going to Siberia&mdash;well, I went myself
because I have a profound distrust of Russian
officials. Even an Imperial pardon has a knack
of arriving too late when it is desirable that it
should do so. It was certainly a disagreeable
season of the year, but behind strong horses
one does not mind that. Very soon Siberia
will have lost its terrors and its romance; there
will be a railway across the Urals, and all chance
of the little excitements attendant on such a
journey as mine will be over. When the
Governor saw me actually in Tobolsk, he could
not believe his eyes. If his beard had not
been dyed, it would have turned white with
the extremity of his amazement. I think he
could have understood my taking the trouble if
it had been for a Tchin; but for a mere scribbler
of books, a mere teller of stories! I told
him that Homer, and Ariosto, and Goethe, and
ever so many others had been only tellers of
stories too, but that produced no impression
on him. He was compelled to let Boganof go,
because the Tzar ordered him, but he could
not see any valid reason why Boganof should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
not be left to rot away, brain downwards,
under the ice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She laughed a little at the recollection of it
all; it had been called an eccentric hair-brained
thing at the time by all her world,
but she had taken Boganof back with her in
triumph, and had not left him until she had
seen him seated by the stove of his own humble
house in Odessa.</p>

<p>It had been one of the best moments of
her life&mdash;yes, certainly&mdash;but it did not seem
to her that she had done anything remarkable.
It had been so absurd to send a man to dwell
amidst eternal snows and semi-eternal darkness
because he had written a clever novel in which
the wiseacres of the third section had seen fit to
discover revolutionary doctrines, that when the
wife and mother of Boganof, knowing her influence
at Court, and having chance of access
to her through her steward, threw themselves
at her feet one day, and besought her compassion
and assistance, she had been surprised
into promising her aid, from that generosity
and sympathy with courage which always lived
beneath the artificiality and indifference of her
habits and temper. No doubt they had suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>ceeded
because they had come upon her in a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon moment</i>; no doubt they might have found
her in moods in which they might as well have
appealed to the Japanese bronzes in her vestibule;
but, having been touched and surprised
into a promise, she had kept it through much
difficulty and with an energy which bore down
all opposition.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She looks as frail as a reed, but she has
the force of a lance,&rsquo; the autocrat to whom
she appealed, and who was at the onset utterly
opposed to her petition, had thought as he had
answered her coldly that Boganof was a dangerous
writer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So were all the Encyclopædists; but the
great Catherine was not afraid of them; will
you, the Father of your people, refuse to one
of those the protection which she was proud
to grant to Frenchmen?&rsquo; she had said to the
Emperor, with many another persuasive and
audacious argument, to which he had listened
with a smile because the lovely mouth of the
Princess Napraxine had spoken them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was a very noble thing to do,&rsquo; repeated
Melville.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; she also repeated; &lsquo;it amused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
me. It frightened everybody else. The Tzar
was at Livadia unusually late; there was first
to go to him from here; when I reached
Livadia, he was everything that was kind to me
personally, but I found him terribly angered
against the poor novelist, and all his courtiers
were of course ready to swear that Boganof
was Satan; poor innocent Boganof, with his
tender heart always aching over the sorrows
of the poor, and the mysteries of animal
suffering! I told the Emperor that Boganof
was, on the contrary, a type of all that was best
in the Russian people; of that obedience, of
that faith, of that fortitude, which the Russian
possesses in a stronger degree than any other
of the races of man. Where will you find as
you find in Russia the heroic silence under
torture, the unwavering adherence to a lost
cause, the power of dying mute for sake of an
idea, the uncomplaining surrender of youth, of
beauty, of all enjoyment, often of rank and
riches, to a mere impersonal duty? They are
all sacrificed to dreams, it is true; but they
are heroic dreams which have a greatness that
looks fine in them, beside the vulgar greeds,
and the vulgar content of ordinary life. I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
something to that effect to the Tzar. &ldquo;You
fill your mines and prisons, sir, with these
people,&rdquo; I said to him. &ldquo;Greece would have
raised altars to them. They are the brothers
of Harmodius; they are the sisters of Læna.&rdquo;
I suppose it is wonderful that he did not send
me to the prisons; I dare say, if I had been an
ugly woman he would have done; he was, on
the contrary, very indulgent, and, though he
was hard to move at first, he ended with the
utmost leniency.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I was really quite in earnest at the time,&rsquo;
she continued, now, with a little wondering
astonishment at such remembrances of herself.
&lsquo; I urged on the Tzar the truth that, when
the intellect of a nation is suppressed and persecuted,
the nation &ldquo;dies from the top,&rdquo; like
Swift. I think I convinced him for the moment,
but then there were so many other people
always at his ear to persuade him that universal
convulsion was only to be avoided by corking
all the inkbottles, and putting all the writers
and readers down the mines. Prince Napraxine,
by the way, was in a terrible state when he
heard of it all. He was away in Paris at the
time, and you may imagine that I did not tele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>graph
to ask his consent. Indeed, he first learnt
what I had done from the Russian correspondent
of <cite>Figaro</cite>, and took the whole story for
one of <cite>Figaro&rsquo;s</cite> impudent fictions. He went to
the bureau in a towering rage, and, I think,
broke a Malacca cane over a sub-editor. Then
he telegraphed to me, and found it was all true
enough; he might more wisely have telegraphed
first, for the sub-editor brought an action for
assault against him, and he had a vast deal of
money to pay. He abhors the very name of
Boganof. Last New Year&rsquo;s day I had all
Boganof&rsquo;s novels in the Russian text, bound in
vellum, as a present from him; I thought he
would have had an apoplectic fit.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Her pretty, chill laughter completed the
sentence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My honesty, however, compels me to confess,&rsquo;
she continued, &lsquo;that for an unheroic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">boulevardier</i>
and a strongly conservative <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tchin</i> like
my husband, the position was a trying one.
He abhors literature, liberal doctrines, and
newspaper publicity; and the story of my
journey for and with Boganof met him in
every journal, in every club, in every city of
Europe. The publicity annoyed me myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
very much. I think the way in which
journalists seize on everything and exaggerate
it to their own purposes will, in time, prevent
any action, a little out of the common, ever
taking place at all. People will shut themselves
up in their own shells like oysters. I
should have left Boganof to the governor of
Tobolsk, who was so anxious to keep him, if I
had ever foreseen the annoyance which the
Press was destined to cause me about him.
When I met the Tzar afterwards he said,
&ldquo;Well, Princess, are you still convinced now
that the ink-bottle contains the most harmless
and holy of fluids?&rdquo; and I answered him that
I granted it might contain a good deal of gas
and a good deal of gall, yet still I thought it
wiser not to cork it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Princess,&rsquo; said Melville, with a little hesitation,
&lsquo;one cannot but regret that a person
capable of such fine sympathy and such noble
effort as yourself should pass nearly the whole
of her time in sedulously endeavouring to persuade
the world that she has no heart and
herself that she has no soul. Why do you
do it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She gave a little contemptuous gesture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
&lsquo;I do not believe I have either,&rsquo; she said.
&lsquo; When I was a tiny child, my father said to
me, &ldquo;Douchka, you will have no dower, but
you will have plenty of wit, two big eyes, and
a white skin.&rdquo; The possession of these three
things has always been the only fact I have
ever been sure of, really! Do not begin to talk
theologically; you are delightful as a man of
the world, but as a priest you would bore me
infinitely. One thinks out all that sort of thing
for oneself: ostensibly, I am of the Greek
Church; actually, I am of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s creed,
which has never been able to find a key to the
mystery of the universe, &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quelle loi a donné la
bête effarée à l&rsquo;homme cruel?</i>&rdquo; The horse
strains and shivers under the whip, the brutal
drunkard kicks him in his empty stomach:
God looks on, if He exist at all, in entire indifference
throughout tens of thousands of ages.
You say the patient animal has no soul, and
that the sodden drunkard has one. I do not
admire your religion, which enables you
placidly to accept such an absurdity, and such
an injustice, as a Divine creation. Do not say
that poets do no good; they do more than
priests, my dear friend. I had been reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
that poem of Hugo&rsquo;s, the <cite>Melancholia</cite>, at the
moment when Boganof&rsquo;s wife and mother
brought their petition to me. It had made me
in a mood for pity. You know that is the
utmost a woman ever has of any goodness&mdash;a
mere mood. It is why we are so dangerous in
revolutions: we slay one minute, and weep the
next, and dance the next, and are sincere enough
in it all. If they had come to me when I had
been annoyed about anything, or when I had
had a toilette I disliked, or a visit that had
wearied me, I should have said &ldquo;No,&rdquo; and left
Boganof in Siberia. It was the merest chance,
the merest whim&mdash;all due to the <cite>Melancholia</cite>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whim, or will, I am sure Boganof was
grateful?&rsquo; asked Melville.</p>

<p>Her voice softened: &lsquo;Oh yes, poor soul!
But he died six months afterwards of tubercular
consumption, brought on by exposure
and bad food in Siberia. You see, imperial
pardons may arrive too late, even if one carry
them oneself!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But he died at home,&rsquo; said Melville;
&lsquo;think how much that is!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;For the sentimentalists,&rsquo; she added, with
her cruel little smile, but her eyes were dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
as she glanced upward at the stars in the
north.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor Boganof!&rsquo; she said, after a pause,
with a vibration of unresisted emotion in her
voice. &lsquo;There is another problem to set beside
your Rose. The world is full of them.
Your Christianity does not explain them. He
was the son of a country proprietor, a poor
one, but he had a little estate, enough for his
wants. He was a man of most simple tastes
and innocent desires: he might have lived, as
Tourguenieff might have lived, happy all his
humble days on his own lands; but he had
genius, or something near it. He believed in
his country and in mankind; he had passionate
hopes and passionate faiths; he knew he would
lose all for saying the truth as he saw it, but
he could not help it; the truth in him was
stronger than he, he could not restrain the fire
that was in him&mdash;a holy fire, pure of all personal
greed. Well, he has died for being so
simple, being so loyal, being so impersonal and
so unselfish. If he had been an egotist, a
time-server, a sycophant, he would have lived
in peace and riches. Your Christianity has no
explanation of that! Musset&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">être immobile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
qui regarde mourir</i>&rdquo; is all we see behind the
eternal spectacle of useless suffering and unavailing
loss.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She turned and drew her laces closer about
her head, and passed quickly through the
shadows to the house.</p>

<p>Melville in answer sighed.</p>

<p>That night, when Melville stood at his windows
looking over the immense flat landscape,
green with waving corn and rolling grass lands
and low birch woods which stretched before
him silvered by the effulgence of a broad
white moon, he thought of Nadine Napraxine
curiously, wistfully, wonderingly, as a man
who plays chess well puzzles over some chess
problem that is too intricate for him. The
explanation we give of ourselves is rarely
accepted by others, and he did not accept hers
of herself; that she was the creature of the
impression of the moment. It seemed to him
rather that hers was a nature with noble and
heroic impulses crusted over by the habits of
the world and veiled by the assumption rather
than the actuality of egotism. She, too, could
have been a sister of Læna, he thought.</p>

<p>What waste was here of a fine nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
sedulously forcing itself and others to believe
that it was worthless, wearied by the pleasures
which yet made its only kingdom, cynical,
lonely, incredulous, whilst at the height of
youth and of all possession!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
</div>


<p>Othmar, faithful to his word, remained at the
château of Amyôt throughout the spring and
summer months, indifferent to the laughter of
the world, if it did laugh. He divined very
accurately that one person at least laughed and
made many a satiric sketch to her friends of
himself <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">filant le parfait amour</i>, and gathering
wood violets, wood anemones, wood strawberries,
beneath the shadows of his Valois
trees in glades which had been old when the
original of Jean Goujon&rsquo;s Diane Chasseresse
had been young.</p>

<p>Amyôt seemed to him to suit the youth,
the grace, and the gravity of Yseulte better
than any babble of the great world;&mdash;Amyôt,
which was like a stately illuminated chronicle
of kingly and knightly history, which was as
silent as the grave of a king in a crypt, and
which was shut out from the fret of mankind
by the screen of its Merovingian forests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>He was scarcely conscious that he lingered
in this seclusion from an unacknowledged unwillingness
to go where he would see and hear
of another woman; he persuaded himself that
he chose to stay on in the provinces partially
because the tumult of the world was always
vulgar, noisy, and offensive to him, chiefly
because nowhere else in the world so surely as
in one of his own country houses could he be
certain not to meet the woman who had
wounded him mortally, yet whom he loved far
more than he hated her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is absolutely necessary that you should
be seen in Paris, and that you should receive
there; it is absolutely necessary that you should
sustain your position in the world,&rsquo; said
Friederich Othmar, with much emphasis as he
sat at noon one day on the great terrace of
Amyôt. Othmar laughed a little, and shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Amyôt is magnificently kept up&mdash;that I
admit,&rsquo; continued the elder man. &lsquo;It is a
place that it is well to have, to spend six weeks
of the autumn in, to entertain princes at; it is
quite royal, and was one of the best purchases
that my father ever made. But to bury your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>self
here!&mdash;when the Kaiser comes to Paris,
to whom you owe by tradition every courtesy&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Othmars were never received at the
Court of Vienna.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Baron made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We are Parisians, but we are Croats before
all. Sometimes you are pleased to insist very
strongly that we are Croats, and nothing else.
If we are so, the Emperor is our sovereign.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is disputed in Croatia, which has never
been too loyal!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Croatia be&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo; said Friederich Othmar,
with difficulty restraining the oath because
Yseulte was seated within hearing; and he returned
to his old arguments, which were all
brought to bear upon the fact that at the approach
of winter Othmar owed it as a duty to
society and to himself to throw open the doors
of that vast hotel on the Boulevard S. Germain,
which had always seemed to him the most
hateful embodiment of the wealth, the unscrupulousness,
and the past history of his
race.</p>

<p>The hotel had been purchased from the Duc
de Coigny during the White Terror by Marc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
Othmar for a nominal price; and under the
reign of Louis Philippe, Stefan Othmar, deeming
it neither grand nor luxurious enough, had had
it changed and redecorated in the worst taste
of the epoch, and, in the early days of the
Second Empire, had farther enlarged and overloaded
it, until to his son it was as a very
nightmare of gilding, marble, and allegorical
painting, a Cretan labyrinth of enormous and
uninhabitable chambers, fit for such motley
crowds as cram the Elysée in the days of Grevy.</p>

<p>It was one of the show-houses of Paris,
and had, indeed, many real treasures of art
amidst its overloaded luxury, but Othmar hated
it in its entirety, from its <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-cochère</i>, where
the arms which the heralds had found for Marc
Othmar had replaced the shield and crown of
the Ducs de Coigny, to the immense library,
which did not contain a single volume that he
cared to open; an &lsquo;upholsterer&rsquo;s library,&rsquo; with
all its books, from Tacitus to Henri Martin,
clad in the same livery of vellum and tooled
gold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Absolutely necessary to sustain your position
in the world!&rsquo; repeated Othmar when his
uncle had left him. &lsquo;That is always the in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>cantation
with which the fetish of the world
obtains its sacrifices. Translated into common
language, he means that as I have a great deal
of money, other people expect me to spend much
of it upon them. I do not see the obligation,
at least not socially.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you desire the life of Paris?&rsquo; he added
abruptly to Yseulte, who hesitated, coloured
slightly, and said with timidity:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I should prefer S. Pharamond.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;S. Pharamond is yours,&rsquo; said Othmar
with some embarrassment, knowing why every
rood of that sunny and flowering shore seemed
to him nauseous with sickening memories.
&lsquo;S. Pharamond is yours, my dear; but I
scarcely think that we can pass this winter
there. There are tedious duties from which
we cannot escape; to entertain in Paris is one
of them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>An older woman would have perceived
that he contradicted himself, but Yseulte was
blinded to such anomalies by her adoration of
him; an adoration as intense as it was meek,
dumb, and most humble.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am so perfectly happy here,&rsquo; she answered,
with hesitation; &lsquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>She was not actuated by the sentiment
which he attributed to her hesitation; she
infinitely preferred the country to the city, as
all meditative and poetic tempers do, and the
little she had seen of the great world at Millo
made her dread her entry into it in Paris. What
she wished, but lacked the courage to say, was,
that she perceived that the country did not
satisfy him himself. She was not so dull of
comprehension that she did not see the melancholy
of her husband, the listless indifference,
the unspoken ennui, which spoiled his years
to him, and left him without energy or interest
in life. She could discern the wound she knew
not how to cure, and Friederich Othmar in
his conversations with her had repeatedly assured
her that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie de province</i> stifled the
intelligence of a man as moss grows over the
trunk of a tree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am so happy here,&rsquo; she answered now
with hesitation, &lsquo;but still&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But still you are a daughter of Eve,&rsquo; he
added with indulgence. &lsquo;My poor child, it is
quite natural, you are so young; all young
girls long for the life of the world. It robs
them of their lilies and roses, it draws bistre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
shadows under their eyes, it makes them old
before they are twenty, but still they kiss the
feet of their Moloch! I do not think, though,
that you will ever be hurt by the world yourself.
You are too serious, and have at once too
much humility and too much pride: they are
safe warders at the door of the soul; you will
not easily become a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaine</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the difference?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In the world, when she belongs to it, a
woman crushes her soul as she crushes her
waist; she is a butterfly, with the sting of an
asp; she wastes her brain in the council-chambers
of her tailors, and her time in a
kaleidoscope of amusements that do not even
amuse her; she would easily make the most
hideous thing beautiful if she put it on once,
and the most flagrant vice the fashion if she
adopted it for a week; she has given the
highest culture possible to her body and to her
brain, only to spend her years in an ennui and
an irritation beside which the life of the South
Sea islanders would seem utility and wisdom;
she has the clearest vision, the finest intelligence,
the shrewdest wit, only to set her ambition
on having a whole audience of a theatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
forget the stage because she has entered her
box, or the entire journals of a city chronicle
the suicide of some madman who has taken
his life because she crossed out his name on
her tablets before a cotillon&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>He paused abruptly, becoming suddenly
conscious that he was speaking in no general
terms, and had only before his thoughts the
vision of one woman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, my dear,&rsquo; he said kindly, passing his
hand over the shining tresses of Yseulte; &lsquo;I
am not afraid that you will become a coquette
or a lover of folly; you will not learn the
slang of the hour, or yellow your white skin
with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maquillage</i>; you will always be the young
patrician of the time of the Lady of Beaujeu.
You shall go to Paris if you wish, and do just
as you like there; you must not blame me if
it do not suit you better than it suits those
roses which your foster-mother sends up in moss
from her garden.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor child!&rsquo; he thought, with a pang of
conscience. &lsquo;She has a right to enjoy any
amusement she can. She is young; the world
will be a play-place to her; if she can make
for herself friends, interests, pastimes, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
be the last to prevent her. Sooner or later
she will find out that she is so little to me.
She is content now because she takes kindness
for love, and because, in her innocence, she cannot
conceive how one&rsquo;s senses may be roused
while one&rsquo;s heart may lie dumb and cold as a
stone. But when she is older she will perceive
all that, and then the more friends she has
found, and the less she leans on me, the less
unhappy she will be. I will give her everything
that she can wish for; all women grow
contented and absorbed in the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he argued with himself, but he knew all
the while that he was to blame in desiring that
sort of compensation and consolation for her;
and that delicacy of taste, which has over some
temperaments a stronger control than conscience,
made him feel that there was a kind
of vulgarity in thus persuading himself that
material gifts and material triumphs would
atone to her for the indifference of his feelings
and the absence of his sympathy.</p>

<p>It was something better than mere material
possessions and indulgences which he had meant
to give the child whose lonely fate had touched
him to so much pity under the palm trees of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
S. Pharamond and the gilded roofs of Millo.
But he dismissed the rebuke of this memory
with impatience. The world had so repeatedly
told him that his gold was capable of purchasing
heaven and earth, that, though he
found it of no avail for himself, he fell instinctively
into the error of imagining that with it
at least he could heal all wounds not his own.
She should have all her fancy could desire.
His experience of women told him that she
would be very unlike them if, in all the
pleasure of acquisition, emulation, and possession,
she did not find at least a fair simulacrum
of happiness. She would be one out of a
million&mdash;but if she were that one? Then her
soul might starve in the midst of all her
luxuries and pageants, like a bird in a golden
cage that dies for want of the drop of water
which the common brown sparrow, flying over
the ploughed brown field, can find at will.
But he did not think of that.</p>

<p>He knew that it was unworthy to speculate
upon the power of the lower life to absorb into
itself a soul fitted by its affinities to discover
and enjoy the higher. He shrank from his
own speculations as to the possibility of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
world replacing himself in her affections. He
had honestly intended, when he had taken her
existence into his charge, to study, reverence,
and guide this most innocent and docile nature;
and endeavour, beside her, to seek out some
trace of the purer ideals which had haunted his
youth. And he felt, with remorse, that the
failure to do so lay with himself, not with her.
She remained outside his life; she had no
sorcery for him. She was a lovely and almost
faultless creature, but she was not what he
loved. He realised, with bitter self-reproach,
that in a moment of impulse, not ignoble in
itself, but unwise, he had burdened his own
fate and perhaps unconsciously done a great
wrong to her, since, in the years to come, she
would ask at his hands the bread of life and he
would only be able to give her a stone.</p>

<p>She herself had as yet no idea that she was
not beloved by Othmar with a lover&rsquo;s love.
She knew nothing of men and their passions.
She had not the grosser intuitions which could
have supplied the place of experience. She
did not perceive that his tenderness had little
ardour, his embraces nothing of the fervour
and the eagerness of delighted possession. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
had no standard of comparison by which to
measure the coldness or the warmth of the
desires to which she surrendered herself, and
it was not to so spiritual a temperament as
hers that the familiarities of love could ever
have seemed love. But her nerves were sensitive,
her perceptions quick; and they made
her conscious that mentally and in feeling
Othmar was altogether apart from her; that
in sorrow she would not have consoled him,
and that in his meditations she never had any
place.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When I am older he will trust me more,&rsquo;
she reflected, in her innocence, and she had
been so long used to repression and obedience
that it cost her much less than it would have
cost most women of her years to accept, uncomplainingly,
that humble place before the
shut doors of his life.</p>

<p>She was too modest to be offended at a
distraction which would have been certain to
excite the offence and the suspicion of a more
selfish or self-conscious nature; and she was
too young to be likely to penetrate by intuition
the secret of that evident joylessness which
might well have excited her jealousy. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
rather the same sense of pity which had come
to her for him in the weeks before her marriage
which grew strongest in her as the months
passed on at Amyôt. He enjoyed and
possessed so much, yet could not enjoy or
possess his own soul in peace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do not think he is happy, and it is not
I who can make him happy,&rsquo; she said once,
very timidly, to Friederich Othmar, who answered
with considerable impatience:</p>

<p>&lsquo;My love, the fault does not lie with you.
Otho, who believes himself, like Hamlet, out of
joint with his time, is in reality a man of his
times in everything; that is, he is a pessimist;
he has a mental nevrose, to borrow the jargon
of scientists; he has so cultivated his conscience
at the expense of his reason, that I sometimes
believe he will be satisfied with nothing but
the abandonment of all he possesses; and no
doubt he would have tried this remedy long
since, only he has no belief in any Deity who
would reward him for it. The misfortune of
all the thoughtful men of Otho&rsquo;s generation is,
that they combine with their fretful consciences
an entire disbelief in their souls, so that they
are a mass of irritable anomalies. The mirth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>ful
sceptics of Augustan Rome, of Voltairian
France, and of Bolingbroke&rsquo;s England, were all
consistent philosophers and voluptuaries; they
disbelieved in their souls, but they believed in
their bodies, and were amply content with
them. They never talked nonsense about duty,
and they passed gaily, gracefully, and consistently
through their lives, of which they made
the best they could materially, which is only
reasonable in those who are convinced that the
present is the sole sentient existence they will
ever enjoy. But the tender-nerved pessimists
of Otho&rsquo;s kind and age are wholly inconsistent.
They believe in nothing, and yet they are
troubled by a multitude of misgivings; they
think the soul is merely a romantic word for
the reflex action of the brain, and yet they distress
themselves with imagining that the human
animal has innumerable duties, and should have
innumerable scruples, which is ridiculous on
the face of it, for, religion apart and Deity
denied, there is no possible reason why man
should have any more duties than a snail has,
or a hare. The agnostics of the present generation
do not perceive this contradiction in
themselves, and that is why they look so incon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>sistent
and so entirely valetudinarian beside the
robust Atheism of the past century, and are,
indeed, the mere <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">malades imaginaires</i> of the
moral hospital.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I could only make him as happy as I
am myself,&rsquo; she said again; but she had not
the talisman which the woman who is beloved
in return holds in the hollow of her hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She is too young,&rsquo; thought Friederich
Othmar, angrily. &lsquo;She is too innocent; she is
a daisy, a dove, a child. She knows nothing
of persuasion or provocation; she is not even
aware of her own charms. She waits his
pleasure to be caressed or let alone; she
knows neither how to deny herself or make
herself desired. She wearies him only because
she does not know how to torment him. He
will drift away to someone else who does, while
he will expect her&mdash;at seventeen!&mdash;to be satisfied
with bearing him children and owning his
name!&rsquo;</p>

<p>A few months before, the Baron himself
would have emphatically declared that no
living woman could or should ever need
more. But his nephew&rsquo;s wife had touched
a softer nerve in him; something which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
almost tenderness and almost regret smote
him when he saw the tall, graceful form of
Yseulte like a garden lily, standing alone in
the warmth of the sunset on the terraces at
Amyôt, or saw Othmar, when he approached
after a day&rsquo;s absence, kiss her hand with the
calm and serious courtesy which he would have
displayed to any stranger, and turn away from
her with an indifference which all his deference
of manner and careful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prévoyance</i> of thought
for her could not conceal from the keen eyes
of the elder man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He gives her his caresses, not his companionship,&rsquo;
thought the old man, angrily, but
he was too prudent and too wise to draw her
attention to a fault against herself of which she
was unconscious.</p>

<p>A few months earlier he would have said
with Napoléon, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&lsquo;Qu&rsquo;elle nous donne des marmots;
c&rsquo;est le nécessaire.</i>&rsquo; But before this young mistress
of this stately place as she moved, in her
white gown, with her great bouquet of roses
in her hand and her clear eyes smiling gravely
on these men who so brief a while before had
been unknown to her, and now held all her
destiny in their hands, Friederich Othmar for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the first time in his life saw a little way into a
soul unsoiled, and began to dimly comprehend
some desires not wholly physical, some necessities
sheerly of the mind and heart. The impression
came to him&mdash;a purely sentimental one
for which he chid himself&mdash;that this child was
entirely alone; more alone in her wedded life
perhaps than she would have been in the
monastic. She was surrounded with every
species of material indulgence; day after day
her husband gave her new pleasures, as people
give children new toys; if she had wished for
the impossible he would have endeavoured to
obtain it for her; but Friederich Othmar twice
or thrice in his hurried visits to Amyôt had
found her in solitude, and walking alone in the
stately gardens or sitting alone in some little
rustic temple in the woods, and the fact, though
insignificant enough, seemed to him indicative
of a loneliness which would certainly become
her fate unless she learned as so many other
women have learned, to console herself for
neglect by folly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And that she will not do,&rsquo; the old man said
to himself. &lsquo;She is a pearl; but a pearl thrown,
not before swine, but wasted on a pessimist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuyé</i>, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">délicat</i> whom nothing pleases
except that which he cannot possess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He pitied her for what he foresaw would
befall her in the future, rather than for any
thing which troubled her at that present time,
for although vaguely conscious of a certain discordance
and dissatisfaction in her husband&rsquo;s
life, Yseulte was, in her own, as happy as a very
young girl can be to whom kindliness seems
love and the external beauty surrounding her
appears like a lovely dream.</p>

<p>Othmar left her often to shut himself in his
library, to lose himself in his forests, or to go
for the affairs of his House to Paris; but he was
always gentle, generous, and kind; he was even
prodigal of caresses to her, because they spared
him words in whose utterance he felt himself
untrue; and if the reflex of his own sadness
fell at times across herself, it became a light
soft shadow without name, such as seemed to
suit better than mere vulgar joys the silence
of the gardens and the grandeur of the
courts, where a life of the past, once so
gracious, so vivid, so impassioned in love and
so light in laughter, had been extinguished
like a torch burned out in the night. A riotous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
or exuberant happiness would not have so well
pleased her nature, made serious beyond her
years whilst yet so mere a child, by the pains
of poverty, the companionship of old age, and
the sights and sounds of the siege of Paris.
The long, light, warm days of spring and
summer at Amyôt, with all the floral pomp
around her, and the château itself rising, golden
and silvery in the brilliant air, historic, poetic,
magnificent, airy as a madrigal, martial as an
epic, were days of an ecstatic but of an almost
religious joy to her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What have I done that all this should come
to me?&rsquo; she said often in her wonder and humility,
and Othmar seemed ever to her as a
magician, at whose touch the briars and
brambles in her path had blossomed like the
almond and the may.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
</div>


<p>With October days an accident as her boat
crossed the Loire water, when the autumn
currents were rolling strong and wide, brought
on the premature delivery of a child, who
barely breathed for a few moments, and then
took with him into darkness the hopes of the
Maison d&rsquo;Othmar. The fury and the grief of
Friederich Othmar were so great that they far
surpassed the moderate regret shown by his
nephew, who appeared to him intolerably cold
and little moved save by his sympathy with
the sorrow of the child&rsquo;s young mother.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You would care, I believe, nothing if there
were no one to succeed you when you die!&rsquo;
said the elder man with indignation.</p>

<p>Othmar gave a gesture of indifference.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope I should care for my sons as much
as most men care for theirs,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;But
the &ldquo;succession&rdquo; does not seem to me to be of
vital importance. If you would only believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
it, we are not Hohenzollerns nor Guelfs, and
even they would be easily replaced, though
perhaps Moltke or Wolseley would not be so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why do I, indeed, care so little?&rsquo; said
Othmar to himself when he was alone. &lsquo;I am
neither inhuman nor heartless. I used to be
quickly touched to any kind of feeling; but the
whole of life seems cold to me, and profitless.
I was dry-eyed whilst that poor child wept over
that little, frail, waxen body which was so much
to her; would have been so much to her if it
had lived to lie on her breast. It is the most
pathetic of all possible things&mdash;a girl still sixteen
sorrowing for her offspring which has
perished before it had any separate existence;
has died before it lived; and yet, I feel hardly
more than if I had seen a bird flying round an
empty nest, or a brood of leverets wailing in an
empty form. I think she took my heart out of
my chest that day she fooled me, and put a
stone there&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>He meant Nadine Napraxine, who remained
the one woman on the earth for him.</p>

<p>A woman of unstable impulses, of incalculable
caprices, of an infinite intelligence, of as
infinite an egotism; absorbed in herself, save so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
far as her merciless eyes scanned the whole world
as players, whilst her fastidious taste found them
the poorest players, and judged them inexorably
as dunces and as fools; a woman who had
treated the tragedy of his own passion as a mere
comedy, and had listened to it seriously for a
moment only the better to turn it into jest.</p>

<p>Yet the one woman upon earth whom he
adored, whom he desired.</p>

<p>For love is fate, and will neither be commanded
nor gainsaid.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
